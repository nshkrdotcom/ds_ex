# DSPEx Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Status: Foundation Complete, Phase 2 Migration Complete

The DSPEx foundation is **complete and working**. All core modules are implemented and tested. Phase 1 (Critical Program Utilities) and Phase 2 (Enhanced Test Infrastructure) are **COMPLETED**. Ready to start Phase 3.

**ðŸ“‹ Next Action:** Begin Phase 3 (Critical Concurrent Tests) per `./TODO_02_PRE_SIMBA/TEST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

---

## Test Strategy: Phase-Tagged Testing

### Current Test Organization

**All existing tests are tagged `:phase_1` and excluded by default** to streamline the migration process:

```bash
# Current development workflow (only new/migrated tests)
mix test                    # Runs only migrated tests (clean development)
mix format                  # Format code before commits
mix dialyzer               # Must pass (zero warnings)

# Include Phase 1 tests when needed
mix test --include phase_1  # Runs ALL tests (existing + migrated)
```

### Migration Process

As tests are migrated from `TODO_02_PRE_SIMBA/test/` and `test_phase2/`, they will:
1. **Run by default** with `mix test` (no tags)
2. **Be fully green** before commit
3. **Pass dialyzer** before commit
4. **Be formatted** with `mix format` before commit

**Commit Strategy:**
- âœ… One commit per migration phase
- âœ… All migrated tests 100% green
- âœ… Dialyzer passes with zero warnings  
- âœ… Code formatted consistently

## Quick Reference: Working End-to-End Pipeline

> **Note:** This workflow is fully functional but requires `--include phase_1` to run the tests.

### **Complete Teleprompter Workflow (Already Working)**
```elixir
# 1. Define signatures
defmodule QASignature do
  use DSPEx.Signature, "question -> answer"
end

# 2. Create teacher and student programs
teacher = DSPEx.Predict.new(QASignature, :gpt4)
student = DSPEx.Predict.new(QASignature, :gpt3_5)

# 3. Prepare training examples
examples = [
  %{inputs: %{question: "What is 2+2?"}, outputs: %{answer: "4"}}
]

# 4. Run teleprompter optimization
metric_fn = fn example, prediction ->
  if example.outputs.answer == prediction.answer, do: 1.0, else: 0.0
end

{:ok, optimized} = DSPEx.Teleprompter.BootstrapFewShot.compile(
  student, teacher, examples, metric_fn
)

# 5. Use optimized program
{:ok, result} = DSPEx.Program.forward(optimized, %{question: "What is 3+3?"})
```

### **Test Commands (Phase 1 - Existing Foundation)**
```bash
# Phase 1 tests (existing foundation - all working)
mix test --include phase_1          # All foundation tests
mix test.fallback --include phase_1 # Development with API fallback  
mix test.live --include phase_1     # Integration testing

# Quality assurance (always required)
mix dialyzer                        # Type checking (zero warnings)
mix credo                          # Code quality
mix format                         # Code formatting
```

## Migration Progress Tracking

**Current Phase:** Phase 3 (Critical Concurrent Tests) - Ready to Start

**Completed Phases:**
- âœ… Phase 0: Pre-Migration Validation (infrastructure setup)
- âœ… Phase 1: Critical Program Utilities (56 new tests)
- âœ… Phase 2: Enhanced Test Infrastructure (15 new tests)

**Current Status:**
- **Total Tests:** 453 tests (vs 382 baseline)
- **New Tests Added:** 71 tests for SIMBA preparation
- **All Tests Passing:** 452/453 (1 flaky performance test)

**Next Steps:**
1. ðŸš€ Begin Phase 3: Critical concurrent and stress tests
2. ðŸ“Š Migrate high-priority performance validation tests
3. ðŸ§ª Continue with Phase 4-6 per migration plan

**Success Criteria for Each Phase:**
- âœ… All migrated tests pass with `mix test`
- âœ… `mix dialyzer` passes with zero warnings
- âœ… `mix format` applied before commit
- âœ… No regressions in existing functionality

**Foundation Status: ðŸŸ¢ SOLID - Ready for SIMBA preparation! ðŸš€**
