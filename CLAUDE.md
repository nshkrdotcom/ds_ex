# DSPEx Development Status & Next Steps

## Current Status: Foundation Complete, Phase 2 Migration Complete

The DSPEx foundation is **complete and working**. All core modules are implemented and tested. Phase 1 (Critical Program Utilities) and Phase 2 (Enhanced Test Infrastructure) are **COMPLETED**. Ready to start Phase 3.

**📋 Next Action:** Begin Phase 3 (Critical Concurrent Tests) per `./TODO_02_PRE_SIMBA/TEST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md`

---

## Test Strategy: Phase-Tagged Testing

### Current Test Organization

**All existing tests are tagged `:group_1` and `:group_2` and excluded by default** to streamline the migration process:

```bash
# Current development workflow (only new/migrated tests)
mix test                    # Runs only migrated tests (clean development)
mix format                  # Format code before commits
mix dialyzer               # Must pass (zero warnings)

# Include foundation tests when needed
mix test --include group_1 --include group_2  # Runs ALL tests (foundation + migrated)
```

### Migration Process

As tests are migrated from `TODO_02_PRE_SIMBA/test/` and `test_phase2/`, they will:
1. **Run by default** with `mix test` (no tags)
2. **Be fully green** before commit
3. **Pass dialyzer** before commit
4. **Be formatted** with `mix format` before commit

**Commit Strategy:**
- ✅ One commit per migration phase
- ✅ All migrated tests 100% green
- ✅ Dialyzer passes with zero warnings  
- ✅ Code formatted consistently

## Quick Reference: Working End-to-End Pipeline

> **Note:** This workflow is fully functional but requires `--include phase_1` to run the tests.

### **Complete Teleprompter Workflow (Already Working)**
```elixir
# 1. Define signatures
defmodule QASignature do
  use DSPEx.Signature, "question -> answer"
end

# 2. Create teacher and student programs
teacher = DSPEx.Predict.new(QASignature, :gpt4)
student = DSPEx.Predict.new(QASignature, :gpt3_5)

# 3. Prepare training examples
examples = [
  %{inputs: %{question: "What is 2+2?"}, outputs: %{answer: "4"}}
]

# 4. Run teleprompter optimization
metric_fn = fn example, prediction ->
  if example.outputs.answer == prediction.answer, do: 1.0, else: 0.0
end

{:ok, optimized} = DSPEx.Teleprompter.BootstrapFewShot.compile(
  student, teacher, examples, metric_fn
)

# 5. Use optimized program
{:ok, result} = DSPEx.Program.forward(optimized, %{question: "What is 3+3?"})
```

### **Test Commands (Foundation Groups - Existing Foundation)**
```bash
# Foundation tests (existing foundation - all working)
mix test --include group_1 --include group_2  # All foundation tests
mix test.fallback --include group_1 --include group_2 # Development with API fallback  
mix test.live --include group_1 --include group_2     # Integration testing

# Quality assurance (always required)
mix dialyzer                        # Type checking (zero warnings)
mix credo                          # Code quality
mix format                         # Code formatting
```

2. Create `test/unit/teleprompter_advanced_test.exs`  
3. Implement required utility functions as needed
4. Validate advanced program introspection capabilities

**Step 2: Edge Case Implementation**
1. Create `test/unit/system_edge_cases_test.exs`
2. Create `test/unit/bootstrap_advanced_test.exs`
3. Implement robust error handling scenarios
4. Add graceful degradation mechanisms

**Step 3: Performance Integration**
1. Review existing performance tests to avoid duplication
2. Migrate complementary performance tests
3. Integrate component-level performance metrics
4. Validate performance baseline extensions

#### Validation Checkpoints

**After Each Batch:**
```bash
mix test test/unit/ --max-failures 1
mix test test/performance/ --max-failures 1  
mix dialyzer
```

**Final Phase 5 Validation:**
```bash

### 🛡️ Risk Management

#### **High-Risk Areas**
1. **Complex Edge Cases**: May expose fundamental architectural limitations
   - **Mitigation**: Implement fixes for critical issues, document known limitations
   - **Fallback**: Defer non-critical edge cases to post-SIMBA if needed

2. **Advanced Utility Dependencies**: May require significant new utility functions
   - **Mitigation**: Implement minimal viable versions first
   - **Fallback**: Create placeholder implementations, technical debt documentation

#### **Medium-Risk Areas**
1. **Performance Test Integration**: Risk of test conflicts or duplication
   - **Mitigation**: Careful review of existing performance tests before migration
   - **Resolution**: Rename conflicting tests with `_advanced` suffix
