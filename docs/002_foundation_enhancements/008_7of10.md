Of course. Here is a detailed technical document for the seventh proposed feature enhancement: **"Test Isolation & Mocking Infrastructure."**

### **Technical Specification: Test Isolation & Mocking Infrastructure**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Author:** AI Assistant
**Status:** PROPOSED

#### **1. Overview**

This document specifies a set of enhancements to the `foundation` library to provide first-class support for test isolation and service mocking. The current `ServiceRegistry` supports namespacing with `{:test, ref}`, which is the correct primitive for isolation. This proposal builds upon that primitive to create a high-level, ergonomic API for developers to write clean, concurrent, and reliable tests for applications built on `foundation`.

The primary driver for this enhancement is the `DSPEx` project. Testing a `DSPEx` program requires replacing its "real" `LM.Client` (which makes paid API calls) with a "mock" client that returns predictable, canned responses. This must be done in a way that is safe for concurrent test execution, ensuring that one test's mock does not interfere with another's.

This enhancement will introduce a new `Foundation.TestSupport` module containing a `with_mocked_service/3` macro, which will become the standard, idiomatic way to test service-dependent code.

---

#### **2. Problem Statement & Use Case**

A developer is writing tests for a `DSPEx.Predict` module. They have two tests that need to run concurrently:
1.  **Test A:** Tests the "happy path." It needs the mocked `LM.Client` to return `{:ok, %{"content" => "Paris"}}`.
2.  **Test B:** Tests a failure path. It needs the mocked `LM.Client` to return `{:error, :rate_limited}`.

Without a proper isolation and mocking framework, this is difficult and dangerous to achieve:
*   **Global Mocks:** Using a library like `Meck` to globally swap the real `LM.Client` module with a mock creates a race condition. If Test A and Test B run at the same time, one test's mock will overwrite the other's, leading to flaky, unpredictable test failures.
*   **Manual Setup:** A developer could manually start a mock `GenServer` for each test and pass its `pid` directly to the `DSPEx.Predict` module. This works but is verbose and requires the developer to handle the setup and teardown boilerplate in every single test.

The goal is to provide a simple, safe, and declarative way to say: *"for the duration of this test block only, whenever any code looks up the `:openai_client` service, give it my mock process instead."*

#### **3. Proposed API and Architecture**

##### **3.1. `Foundation.TestSupport.with_mocked_service/3` (New Macro)**

This will be the primary public API for this feature. It's a macro that provides a sandboxed execution context.

**File:** `lib/foundation/test_support.ex`

**New Macro:**
```elixir
defmodule Foundation.TestSupport do
  @moduledoc "Utilities for testing Foundation-based applications."

  @doc """
  Executes a block of code with a service temporarily replaced by a mock.

  This macro ensures that any lookup for the specified `service_name` within
  the `do` block will resolve to the provided `mock_pid`. The mocking is
  isolated to the current test process and is safe for concurrent execution.

  ## Parameters
    - `service_tuple`: A `{namespace, service_name}` tuple identifying the service to mock.
    - `mock_pid`: The PID of the GenServer or process to use as the mock.
    - `block`: The block of code to execute within the mocked context.
  """
  defmacro with_mocked_service({namespace, service_name}, mock_pid, do: block) do
    quote do
      # 1. Get the unique test reference from the ExUnit context.
      test_ref = Foundation.TestSupport.get_test_ref()
      test_namespace = {:test, test_ref}
      
      # 2. Register the mock PID under the test's unique namespace.
      #    We register it with the *production* service name.
      Foundation.ServiceRegistry.register(test_namespace, unquote(service_name), unquote(mock_pid))
      
      # 3. Temporarily override the process dictionary to point to our test namespace.
      original_namespace = Foundation.ServiceRegistry.get_current_namespace()
      Foundation.ServiceRegistry.set_current_namespace(test_namespace)
      
      try
        # 4. Execute the user's test code.
        unquote(block)
      after
        # 5. Restore the original namespace and clean up.
        Foundation.ServiceRegistry.set_current_namespace(original_namespace)
        # The on_exit hook from setup_isolated_dspy_environment will handle the unregistering.
      end
    end
  end

  # Helper to get the test ref, assumes it's set in a setup block.
  def get_test_ref do
    Process.get(:current_test_ref) || raise "No test reference found. Did you use setup_isolated_dspy_environment()?"
  end
end
```

##### **3.2. Supporting Changes in `ServiceRegistry`**

To support the macro, `ServiceRegistry` needs two new functions to manage the "current" namespace for a given process.

**File:** `foundation/service_registry.ex`
```elixir
defmodule Foundation.ServiceRegistry do
  # ... existing functions ...
  
  @doc "Sets the active namespace for the calling process."
  def set_current_namespace(namespace) do
    Process.put(:foundation_current_namespace, namespace)
  end

  @doc "Gets the active namespace for the calling process, defaulting to :production."
  def get_current_namespace do
    Process.get(:foundation_current_namespace, :production)
  end
  
  # The `lookup` function must be modified to use this new process-local value.
  @spec lookup(service_name :: atom()) :: {:ok, pid()} | {:error, Error.t()}
  def lookup(service_name) do
    # This function no longer takes a namespace; it discovers it.
    namespace = get_current_namespace()
    
    # First, try to look up in the current (potentially test) namespace.
    case ProcessRegistry.lookup(namespace, service_name) do
      {:ok, pid} ->
        {:ok, pid}
      
      :error when namespace != :production ->
        # If in a test namespace and not found, fall back to production namespace.
        # This allows mocking only a subset of services while others remain real.
        ProcessRegistry.lookup(:production, service_name)

      :error ->
        # Not found in production namespace either.
        {:error, create_service_not_found_error(namespace, service_name)}
    end
  end
end
```
**Architectural Change:** The `lookup` function is now "context-aware." It first checks the process-local namespace (which `with_mocked_service` sets to a test-specific one) and then falls back to the `:production` namespace. This allows a test to mock just one service while still being able to access other real, shared services.

##### **3.3. Standard Test Setup**

A standard test setup block will be provided to make this seamless.

```elixir
# in foundation/test_support.ex (or dspex/test/support.ex)

defmacro __using__(_opts) do
  quote do
    use ExUnit.Case, async: true
    import Foundation.TestSupport

    setup do
      test_ref = make_ref()
      Process.put(:current_test_ref, test_ref)
      
      # Optional: Start common services in the test namespace if needed.
      # start_supervised!({MyService, namespace: {:test, test_ref}})
      
      on_exit(fn ->
        # This is crucial for cleanup after each test.
        Foundation.ServiceRegistry.cleanup_test_namespace(test_ref)
      end)
      
      :ok
    end
  end
end

# Example usage in a test file
defmodule MyApp.MyTest do
  use MyApp.DataCase # This would 'use Foundation.TestSupport'
  
  test "..." do
    # ...
  end
end
```

---

#### **4. Example `DSPEx` Test Case**

Here is how a developer would write a test for a `DSPEx` program using this new infrastructure.

```elixir
# in test/dspex/predict_test.exs

defmodule DSPEx.PredictTest do
  use DSPEx.TestCase # Assumes this uses the Foundation.TestSupport setup

  # Define a simple mock LM client
  defmodule MockLM do
    use GenServer
    def start_link(opts), do: GenServer.start_link(__MODULE__, opts, [])
    def init(opts), do: {:ok, opts}
    
    def handle_call({:request, _messages, _opts}, _from, state) do
      # Return a canned response based on the test's needs
      response = Keyword.get(state, :response, {:ok, %{"choices" => [%{"message" => %{"content" => "mocked answer"}}]}})
      {:reply, response, state}
    end
  end

  test "forward returns ok tuple on successful LM call" do
    # 1. Start a mock LM GenServer configured for this specific test case.
    {:ok, mock_lm_pid} = MockLM.start_link(response: {:ok, %{"content" => "Test Passed"}})
    
    # 2. Use the macro to sandbox the execution.
    #    We mock the :openai_client service which is registered in the :production namespace.
    with_mocked_service({:production, :openai_client}, mock_lm_pid) do
      # 3. Inside this block, any code that calls `ServiceRegistry.lookup(:openai_client)`
      #    will receive `mock_lm_pid`.
      
      # The Predict module is configured to look up the :openai_client by name.
      predict_program = %DSPEx.Predict{signature: MyTestSignature, client: :openai_client}
      
      # Run the program.
      result = DSPEx.Program.forward(predict_program, %{question: "test"})
      
      assert {:ok, %DSPEx.Prediction{answer: "Test Passed"}} = result
    end
  end
end
```

---

#### **5. Conclusion**

This enhancement provides a clean, safe, and ergonomic API for a fundamental requirement of application development: testing with mocks. By building this on top of the existing `ServiceRegistry` and its namespacing capabilities, we can offer powerful test isolation that works seamlessly with concurrent test runners.

For `DSPEx`, this is critical. It allows developers to:
*   Write fast, reliable unit tests for their programs without making real API calls.
*   Test complex failure and retry logic by having mocks return specific error tuples.
*   Run their entire test suite in parallel (`mix test --async`) with confidence that tests will not interfere with each other.

This feature elevates `foundation` from a set of production utilities to a complete application development framework that considers the entire development lifecycle, including testing.
