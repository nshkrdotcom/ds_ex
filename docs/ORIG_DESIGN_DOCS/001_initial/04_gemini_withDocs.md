### **Project Plan: Porting DSPy to `DSPEx`**

This document outlines the technical requirements and implementation strategy for creating `DSPEx`, an Elixir-native port of the DSPy framework.

#### **Guiding Principles**

1.  **Embrace OTP:** Do not just transliterate Python. Re-architect components to leverage OTP primitives (`GenServer`, `Supervisor`, `Task`, `Stream`) for concurrency, state management, and fault tolerance.
2.  **Declarative API:** Maintain DSPy's user-friendly, declarative nature through Elixir macros and behaviours.
3.  **Phased Implementation:** Focus on a stable core before building advanced optimizers and features.
4.  **Isolate Python Dependencies:** Acknowledge that some features (e.g., local model serving, finetuning) are heavily Python-based. Isolate these dependencies via well-defined interop boundaries (`Port`, NIFs).

---

### **Phase 1: The Foundational Core**

**Objective:** Implement the minimum viable components to define, run, and evaluate a basic DSPy program. This aligns with the "Polishing the core functionality" objective from the DSPy roadmap.

| Component / Feature | Python (DSPy) Implementation | Elixir (DSPEx) Technical Plan & Info Needed | Docs Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Primitives** | `dspy.Signature`, `dspy.InputField`, `dspy.OutputField`, `dspy.Example`, `dspy.Prediction`, `dspy.Module`, `dspy.Program` | **`DSPEx.Signature`**: Create a `defsignature` macro to parse string signatures (`"in -> out"`) and class-based definitions into a compile-time struct. **Info Needed**: How to handle advanced types like `Literal`, `list[dict[str, str]]`, and custom types (`dspy.Image`, `dspy.History`). This will require a robust type-parsing and validation system within the macro. <br>**`DSPEx.Example` & `Prediction`**: Implement as simple Elixir structs. The `.with_inputs()` method will return a new, immutable struct. `Prediction` will need a `completions` field, which itself is a list of structs. <br>**`DSPEx.Program`**: Define as a `behaviour` with `forward/2` and `acall/2` callbacks. | `learn/programming/signatures.md`, `learn/evaluation/data.md`, `api/modules/Module.md` |
| **2. LM Client (`dspy.LM`)** | Thin wrapper around `litellm`. Handles configuration, caching, and retries. | **`DSPEx.Client.LM`**: Implement as a named, supervised `GenServer`. **Info Needed**: <br>1. **Configuration**: Holds provider, model name, API key, etc. Fetches config from the OTP Application environment. <br>2. **Request Handling**: The public API (`request/2`) will cast to the `GenServer`. The `GenServer` will spawn a supervised `Task` for the actual HTTP call to avoid blocking. <br>3. **Retries**: The supervising process (the one calling `request/2`) will trap exits from the `Task` and implement retry logic (e.g., using a library like `backoff`). This replaces Python's `tenacity`. <br>4. **Streaming & Async**: The `streamify` feature requires the client to support streaming responses. The `Task` can handle this by streaming the HTTP response body back to the caller via messages. | `roadmap.md` (On LMs), `api/models/LM.md`, `api/utils/streamify.md` |
| **3. RM Client (`dspy.Retrieve`)** | Wrappers for various vector DBs (ColBERT, Weaviate, etc.). | **`DSPEx.Client.RM`**: Define a `retrieve/2` `behaviour`. **Info Needed**: A strategy for each backend. <br>1. **HTTP-based RMs** (e.g., `ColBERTv2`): Implement similarly to the `LM` client. <br>2. **Library-based RMs** (e.g., Weaviate, Pinecone): These require Elixir client libraries. If they don't exist, we must decide between writing new ones or using **Python interop (via Ports)**. The interop seems more practical initially. Each RM module will manage its own Port to a dedicated Python script. | `api/tools/ColBERTv2.md`, various `retrieve/*.py` files |
| **4. Basic Modules** | `dspy.Predict`, `dspy.ChainOfThought` | **`DSPEx.Predict`**: A simple module implementing the `Program` behaviour. Its `forward/2` function will call the specified `LM` client. <br>**`DSPEx.ChainOfThought`**: A module that programmatically modifies the signature to add a `reasoning` field before calling `DSPEx.Predict`. This demonstrates module composition. | `learn/programming/modules.md`, `api/modules/Predict.md`, `api/modules/ChainOfThought.md` |
| **5. Evaluation (`dspy.Evaluate`)** | Uses a thread pool to run a program over a dev set. | **`DSPEx.Evaluate.run/3`**: This function will be the primary evaluation entry point. **Technical Plan**: <br>1. Use `Task.async_stream/3` to process the entire dev set concurrently. Each example will run in its own lightweight process. This is a direct, more efficient replacement for Python's `ThreadPoolExecutor`. <br>2. The metric will be an Elixir function reference (`&MyMetric.calculate/2`). <br>3. Needs to handle and report failures gracefully from the stream of results. | `learn/evaluation/overview.md`, `api/evaluation/Evaluate.md` |

---

### **Phase 2: Core Optimization Logic (Teleprompters)**

**Objective:** Implement the core optimizers that represent DSPy's main value proposition. This is a complex phase requiring careful state management.

| Component / Feature | Python (DSPy) Implementation | Elixir (DSPEx) Technical Plan & Info Needed | Docs Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Optimizer Base** | `dspy.teleprompt.Teleprompter` | **`DSPEx.Teleprompter`**: A `behaviour` defining a `compile/3` callback. | `learn/optimization/optimizers.md` |
| **2. Few-Shot Learning (`BootstrapFewShot`)** | Bootstraps examples by running a `teacher` program and filtering traces based on a metric. | **`DSPEx.Teleprompter.BootstrapFewShot`**: Implement as a supervised `GenServer`. **Technical Plan**: <br>1. The `compile` call will `cast` to the `GenServer`, which starts the process asynchronously. <br>2. The `GenServer`'s state will hold the `trainset` and the growing list of bootstrapped demos. <br>3. In its main loop, it will use `Task.async_stream` to run the `teacher` program over the `trainset`. <br>4. It will process the stream of results, apply the metric, and add successful traces to its state. <br>5. Finally, it will construct and return the optimized program. | `api/optimizers/BootstrapFewShot.md`, `faqs.md` |
| **3. Instruction Optimization (`MIPROv2`)** | A complex optimizer involving bootstrapping, instruction proposal, and Bayesian Optimization. | **`DSPEx.Teleprompter.MIPROv2`**: Implement as a supervised `GenServer`. **Technical Plan & Info Needed**: <br>1. **State Management**: The `GenServer` state is more complex, tracking candidate instructions, few-shot demo sets, and trial scores. <br>2. **Sub-programs**: The "grounded proposal stage" is itself a DSPy program. The `GenServer` will invoke this sub-program to generate new instructions. <br>3. **Bayesian Optimization**: This is a major external dependency. **We need to find or build an Elixir library for Bayesian Optimization** (e.g., a port of `scikit-optimize` or similar). If none exists, this is a significant roadblock that might require Python interop. <br>4. **Minibatching**: The optimizer evaluates on minibatches. The `GenServer` will manage sampling from the `valset` for each trial. | `api/optimizers/MIPROv2.md`, `roadmap.md` |
| **4. Finetuning (`BootstrapFinetune`)** | Generates a dataset from traces and launches a finetuning job. | **`DSPEx.Teleprompter.BootstrapFinetune`**: **This is the most significant Python interop challenge.** **Technical Plan**: <br>1. The `GenServer` will perform the data generation step, creating a JSONL file with training examples. <br>2. **It will then use an Elixir `Port` to execute a Python script.** This script will handle the actual finetuning using libraries like `transformers` and `trl`. <br>3. The `GenServer` will monitor the Port for completion status and the path to the finetuned model artifacts. **Info Needed**: The exact format of the training data generated by the Python version's adapters needs to be replicated. | `roadmap.md` (On Finetuning), `api/optimizers/BootstrapFinetune.md` |

---

### **Phase 3: Advanced Modules & Features**

**Objective:** Implement more complex modules and features that improve control, interactivity, and power.

| Component / Feature | Python (DSPy) Implementation | Elixir (DSPEx) Technical Plan & Info Needed | Docs Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Agentic Modules (`dspy.ReAct`)** | An iterative module that uses tools to answer questions. It maintains a stateful "trajectory." | **`DSPEx.ReAct`**: Implement as a `GenServer` per `forward` call. **Technical Plan**: <br>1. The `forward` call spawns a temporary `ReAct` `GenServer`. <br>2. The `GenServer`'s state is the `trajectory`. <br>3. In its loop, it spawns `Task`s for LM calls (to generate thought/action) and tool calls. <br>4. Tools will be passed as Elixir module/function references (`&MyTool.run/1`). <br>5. This naturally isolates the state of each agentic run. | `api/modules/ReAct.md` |
| **2. Code Execution (`dspy.ProgramOfThought`, `dspy.CodeAct`)** | Uses a `PythonInterpreter` to execute generated code in a sandbox. | **`DSPEx.CodeAct`**: This requires a secure code execution sandbox. **Technical Plan & Info Needed**: <br>1. The `dspy.PythonInterpreter` uses Deno. We can replicate this by creating a `Port` to a long-lived Deno process from a `GenServer`. The `GenServer` would manage the sandbox lifecycle. <br>2. The logic for passing tools (as functions) into the sandbox needs to be carefully designed. The Python version injects code; the Elixir version would need to serialize the tool's definition and inject it into the Deno/Python environment. This is a complex interop task. | `api/modules/CodeAct.md` |
| **3. Assertions** | `dspy.Assert` and `dspy.Suggest` use backtracking and dynamic signature modification to enforce constraints. | **`DSPEx.Assert` & `DSPEx.Suggest`**: This can be implemented more idiomatically in OTP. **Technical Plan**: <br>1. An assertion function will not raise an exception. Instead, upon failure, it will send a message (e.g., `{:assertion_failed, feedback}`) to its own process PID. <br>2. The `ProgramProcess` (from Diagram 2) will have a `handle_info` clause for this message. <br>3. Upon receiving the failure message, it can decide to re-run the last `Task` with a modified prompt, effectively implementing the backtrack. The number of retries is managed in the `ProgramProcess` state. This avoids exceptions for control flow. | `learn/programming/7-assertions.md` |
| **4. Streaming** | `dspy.streamify`, `StreamListener`, `StatusMessage` | **`DSPEx.Streaming`**: Elixir is built for this. **Technical Plan**: <br>1. Implement using Elixir's native `Stream` module or, for more power (back-pressure), `GenStage`. <br>2. A `streamify` function will wrap a `Program`, returning a `Stream`. <br>3. The `LM` client must support yielding chunks from the HTTP response. <br>4. `StreamListener` and `StatusMessage` would be `GenStage` consumers that transform the raw token stream into structured events. | `api/utils/streamify.md`, `api/utils/StreamListener.md` |

---

### **Phase 4: Productionization & Developer Experience**

**Objective:** Add features that make `DSPEx` robust for production use, including saving, loading, caching, and observability.

| Component / Feature | Python (DSPy) Implementation | Elixir (DSPEx) Technical Plan & Info Needed | Docs Reference |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Caching** | In-memory `cachetools` and on-disk `diskcache`. | **`DSPEx.Cache`**: Implement as a supervised `GenServer` + ETS table. **Technical Plan**: <br>1. **In-memory**: Use an ETS table for O(1) concurrent reads. The `GenServer` will handle writes. <br>2. **On-disk**: The `GenServer` will manage file I/O for persistence, replacing `diskcache`. The `pyproject.toml` dependency `diskcache>=5.6.0` confirms its importance. <br>3. The `configure_cache` function will start/configure this supervised service. | `faqs.md`, `api/utils/configure_cache.md` |
| **2. Saving & Loading** | `program.save()` and `dspy.load()` using JSON and `cloudpickle`. | **`DSPEx.Program.save/2`**: **Info Needed**: <br>1. For simple state (instructions, demos), serialize to JSON. <br>2. For complex, compiled programs, Elixir's `:erlang.term_to_binary/1` is the native equivalent of `cloudpickle`, allowing the entire state of a `GenServer` or the compiled program struct to be saved and loaded reliably. We will prefer this over JSON for full program state. | `faqs.md`, `api/utils/load.md` |
| **3. Observability & Tracking** | Integrations with MLflow, logging, `inspect_history`. | **`DSPEx.Observability`**: **Technical Plan**: <br>1. **Logging**: Use Elixir's standard `Logger` library. <br>2. **History**: The `dspy.inspect_history` functionality can be replicated by having LM clients log all requests to a central, in-memory store (e.g., an ETS table or Agent) when enabled. <br>3. **Tracing**: Replicate the `with_callbacks` decorator using `:telemetry` handlers. This is the standard Elixir way to create hooks. An external library like `opentelemetry_telemetry` can then automatically convert these events into OpenTelemetry traces for tools like MLflow. | `roadmap.md`, `production/index.md` |
