Of course. Here is a detailed technical document for the second proposed feature enhancement: **"ErrorContext with Step-by-Step Tracing."**

### **Technical Specification: `ErrorContext` with Step-by-Step Tracing**

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Author:** AI Assistant
**Status:** PROPOSED

#### **1. Overview**

This document specifies enhancements to the `Foundation.ErrorContext` module to support structured, step-by-step tracing of complex operations. The current implementation provides "breadcrumbs," which are excellent for tracking the function call stack. This proposal extends that capability to capture the **intermediate data and state** at each logical step of a multi-stage program, which is essential for debugging and analyzing compositional AI systems like those built with `DSPEx`.

The primary driver for this enhancement is the need to debug and observe the behavior of multi-hop or agentic `DSPEx` programs (e.g., `ChainOfThought`, `ReAct`). When such a program fails, a simple stack trace is insufficient; a developer needs to see the sequence of inputs and outputs that led to the failure (e.g., "What was the `thought` that led to the incorrect `tool_call`?").

This enhancement will introduce a new, first-class `:trace` field within the `ErrorContext` and a simple API for appending structured data to it.

---

#### **2. Problem Statement & Use Case**

A `DSPEx.ReAct` program executes a complex loop to answer a question:
1.  **Thought:** The LLM generates a thought: "I should search for the capital of France."
2.  **Action:** It decides to call a `search` tool with the query `"capital of France"`.
3.  **Observation:** The tool returns a list of search results.
4.  **Thought:** The LLM processes the search results and thinks: "The context says Paris is the capital. I can now answer the question."
5.  **Action:** It calls the `finish` tool with the answer "Paris".

If the final answer is incorrect, the developer needs to inspect this entire chain of reasoning. The current `ErrorContext` breadcrumbs might show `ReAct.forward -> Predict.forward -> LM.Client.request`, but it won't show the *data* at each stepâ€”the content of the `thought`, the arguments to the `action`, or the `observation` from the tool.

This enhancement aims to capture that intermediate data directly within the error context, making it available for logging, debugging, and automated analysis.

#### **3. Proposed API and Data Structure Changes**

##### **3.1. `Foundation.Types.ErrorContext` Struct Enhancement**

The core data structure will be updated to include a dedicated `:trace` field.

**File:** `foundation/types/error_context.ex` (or equivalent where the struct is defined)

**New Struct Definition:**
```elixir
defmodule Foundation.ErrorContext do
  # ... existing fields ...
  defstruct [
    # ...
    :breadcrumbs,
    :trace,  # <--- NEW FIELD
    :parent_context
  ]

  @type t :: %__MODULE__{
    # ...
    breadcrumbs: [breadcrumb()],
    trace: [trace_step()], # <--- NEW TYPE
    parent_context: t() | nil
  }

  @typedoc "A single, structured step in an operational trace."
  @type trace_step :: %{
    step_name: atom(),
    data: map(),
    timestamp: integer(),
    duration_ns: non_neg_integer() | nil
  }
end
```

*   **`trace`**: A list of `trace_step` maps, ordered chronologically.
*   **`trace_step`**: A map containing:
    *   `step_name`: An atom identifying the logical step (e.g., `:thought`, `:tool_input`, `:observation`).
    *   `data`: A map containing the structured input/output data for that step.
    *   `timestamp`: A monotonic timestamp marking the start of the step.
    *   `duration_ns` (optional): The duration of the step, if measured.

##### **3.2. New Public API Functions in `Foundation.ErrorContext`**

Two new functions will be added to the public API to manage the trace.

**1. `add_trace_step(context, step_name, data)`**

This function appends a new step to the context's trace log.

```elixir
# in foundation/error_context.ex

@doc """
Adds a structured step to the operation's trace.

This is used to record the intermediate data and state at logical points
within a complex operation, providing a detailed execution history for debugging.
"""
@spec add_trace_step(context :: t(), step_name :: atom(), data :: map()) :: t()
def add_trace_step(%__MODULE__{} = context, step_name, data) do
  new_step = %{
    step_name: step_name,
    data: data,
    timestamp: Utils.monotonic_timestamp()
  }
  
  %{context | trace: (context.trace || []) ++ [new_step]}
end
```

**2. `measure_trace_step(context, step_name, metadata, fun)`**

This is a convenience function that wraps `add_trace_step` and `Telemetry.measure`, automatically recording the duration of a step.

```elixir
# in foundation/error_context.ex

@doc """
Measures the execution of a function, adding a structured step with duration
to the operation's trace.
"""
@spec measure_trace_step(context :: t(), step_name :: atom(), metadata :: map(), (-> result)) :: {t(), result} when result: var
def measure_trace_step(%__MODULE__{} = context, step_name, metadata, fun) do
  {result, duration_ns} = Foundation.Utils.measure(fun)

  new_step = %{
    step_name: step_name,
    data: Map.merge(metadata, %{result: result}), # Include result in trace data
    timestamp: context.start_time, # Should be start time of measurement
    duration_ns: duration_ns
  }
  
  new_context = %{context | trace: (context.trace || []) ++ [new_step]}
  {new_context, result}
end
```

---

#### **4. Example Implementation in `DSPEx.ReAct`**

This shows how a `DSPEx` module would use the new API to build a rich trace.

```elixir
# in a hypothetical dspex/react.ex

defmodule DSPEx.ReAct do
  @behaviour DSPEx.Program

  def forward(program, inputs) do
    # 1. Create the initial error context
    initial_context = Foundation.ErrorContext.new(__MODULE__, :forward, metadata: %{inputs: inputs})
    
    # Start the main reasoning loop with the context
    run_reasoning_loop(program, inputs, initial_context)
  end

  defp run_reasoning_loop(program, inputs, context) do
    # Main ReAct loop
    # ...
    
    # 2. Use `measure_trace_step` to record the "thought" generation
    {context, {:ok, thought_pred}} = Foundation.ErrorContext.measure_trace_step(
      context, 
      :generate_thought, 
      %{prompt: thought_prompt}, 
      fn -> program.thought_generator.forward(%{prompt: thought_prompt}) end
    )
    
    thought = thought_pred.thought
    
    # 3. Use `add_trace_step` to record the parsed action
    {action_name, action_args} = parse_action(thought)
    context = Foundation.ErrorContext.add_trace_step(
      context, 
      :parsed_action,
      %{tool_name: action_name, args: action_args}
    )
    
    # 4. Use `measure_trace_step` to record the tool execution
    {context, {:ok, observation}} = Foundation.ErrorContext.measure_trace_step(
      context,
      :tool_execution,
      %{tool_name: action_name, args: action_args},
      fn -> execute_tool(action_name, action_args) end
    )
    
    # The loop continues, building up the trace within the context...
    # ...
  end
end
```

---

#### **5. Error Reporting and Debugging**

When an error eventually occurs, the `ErrorContext.with_context` function will automatically capture the context, which now includes the detailed trace.

**Enhanced Error Output:**

The `Foundation.Error.to_string/1` function (or a new dedicated `format_trace/1` function) could be enhanced to pretty-print this trace.

**Example Log Output:**
```
[ERROR] [6008:protected_operation_failed] Protected operation failed: "Tool 'search' returned invalid format"
  Correlation ID: req-abc-123
  Operation: DSPEx.ReAct.forward
  Context:
    inputs: %{question: "..."}
  Execution Trace:
    [  0ms] :generate_thought | duration: 1250ms | prompt: "..."
    [1251ms] :parsed_action   | tool_name: "search", args: %{query: "capital of France"}
    [1252ms] :tool_execution  | duration: 850ms | tool_name: "search", args: %{...}
    [2103ms] :generate_thought | duration: 1500ms | prompt: "..."
    [3604ms] :parsed_action   | tool_name: "search", args: %{query: "who is the prime minister"}  <-- Error occurred after this
```
This rich, structured trace gives developers an immediate and complete view of the program's state leading up to the failure, drastically reducing debugging time.

---

#### **6. Implementation Considerations & Dependencies**

*   **Performance:** Appending to a list in a loop (`context.trace || [] ++ [new_step]`) can be inefficient for very long traces. For high-performance scenarios, the `:trace` field could be implemented as a queue or a separate `Agent` process that the `ErrorContext` sends messages to. For the initial implementation, a simple list is sufficient.
*   **Data Sanitization:** The `data` map in a trace step can contain sensitive information. The `add_trace_step` function should internally call a `Foundation.Utils.sanitize_for_logging(data)` function to redact PII or truncate large values before adding them to the context, especially if these contexts will be logged to an external system.
*   **Backwards Compatibility:** Adding a new field to the `ErrorContext` struct is a non-breaking change. Existing code will continue to work, and the `:trace` field will simply be `nil` until it is used.

#### **7. Conclusion**

Integrating step-by-step tracing into `Foundation.ErrorContext` transforms it from a simple call-stack tracker into a powerful **operational debugger**. This feature provides deep visibility into the internal workings of complex, multi-stage programs, which is a critical requirement for building, debugging, and maintaining the kind of agentic AI systems that `DSPEx` is designed to enable. This enhancement is a high-value addition that directly supports the core mission of the `DSPEx` port.
