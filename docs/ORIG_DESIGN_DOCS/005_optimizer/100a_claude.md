I'll analyze the DSPEx MVP design and create a comprehensive implementation plan.Now let me create the detailed technical specification for the foundational module - `DSPEx.Signature`:Based on my analysis of the DSPy codebase and the proposed DSPEx design, I've created a comprehensive implementation plan and detailed specification for the foundational `DSPEx.Signature` module.

## Key Insights from the Analysis:

1. **Clean Separation**: The Elixir design properly separates concerns - signatures are pure compile-time contracts, while adapters handle the runtime formatting complexity.

2. **BEAM Advantages**: The proposed concurrent evaluation engine using `Task.async_stream` will significantly outperform Python's threading model for I/O-bound LLM calls.

3. **Type Safety**: The macro-based approach provides compile-time guarantees that the Python version lacks, while maintaining the same developer ergonomics.

## Why Start with DSPEx.Signature:

1. **Zero Dependencies**: Can be implemented and tested in complete isolation
2. **Foundation**: All other modules depend on this working correctly  
3. **Compile-Time Safety**: Catches errors early in the development cycle
4. **Clear Mapping**: Direct correspondence to Python DSPy's signature system

## Next Steps:

After implementing `DSPEx.Signature`, the natural progression would be:
1. `DSPEx.Client` (HTTP layer with mocks)
2. `DSPEx.Adapter` (depends on Signature)  
3. `DSPEx.Program`/`DSPEx.Predict` (orchestration layer)
4. `DSPEx.Evaluate` (concurrent evaluation engine)
5. `DSPEx.Teleprompter` (optimization algorithms)

The implementation plan provides line-by-line mappings to the original Python code, ensuring we maintain feature parity while leveraging BEAM's strengths in concurrency and fault tolerance.
