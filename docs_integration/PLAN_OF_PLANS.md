## Master Development Strategy

### 🎯 Phase 1: Foundation Consolidation (4-6 weeks)
*"Stabilize the base before building the tower"*

#### 1.1 Critical Behavior Definitions (Week 1)
**Priority**: 🔴 Blocking - Required for all subsequent work

**Scope**: Define missing behaviors that enable contract-first development
- `DSPEx.Client` behavior (CRITICAL - blocks client layer testing)
- `DSPEx.Adapter` behavior (CRITICAL - blocks adapter selection)
- `DSPEx.Evaluator` behavior (HIGH - blocks evaluation system)

**Why Now**: Without these behaviors, we cannot mock or test the variable system integration points.

**Deliverables**:
```elixir
# New behavior definitions
lib/dspex/client.ex     # @callback request/2, request/3
lib/dspex/adapter.ex    # @callback format_messages/2, parse_response/2  
lib/dspex/evaluate.ex   # @callback run/4, run_local/4, run_distributed/4

## Critical Interdependencies & Re-visit Strategy

### 🔄 "Can't Know Till We Get There" Points

#### 1. Variable System Architecture Impact
**Unknown**: How variable abstraction affects existing program performance
**Re-visit Strategy**: Implement basic version first, then optimize based on real performance data
**Triggers**: Performance degradation > 10%, memory usage > 2x baseline

#### 2. Multi-Objective Optimization Complexity
**Unknown**: Real-world performance of Pareto analysis with 4+ objectives
**Re-visit Strategy**: Start with 2 objectives (accuracy, cost), add more based on results
**Triggers**: Optimization time > 5 minutes, convergence issues

#### 3. Elixir Concurrency vs. Python DSPy Performance
**Unknown**: How concurrent variable optimization compares to Python sequential
**Re-visit Strategy**: Benchmark early and often, adjust concurrency strategies
**Triggers**: Performance not meeting 2x Python DSPy baseline

#### 4. Integration Point Friction
**Unknown**: How much existing code needs modification for variable integration
**Re-visit Strategy**: Implement adapters/wrappers first, refactor core later if needed
**Triggers**: Breaking changes > 20% of existing API surface

### 🔗 Critical Dependency Chains

#### Chain 1: Behavior → Variable Testing
```
Behavior Definitions → Mock Implementation → Variable System Testing → Integration Validation
```
**Risk**: Cannot test variable system without proper behavior mocking
**Mitigation**: Prioritize behavior definitions in Phase 1

#### Chain 2: Evaluation → Variable Optimization
```
Enhanced Evaluation → Multi-Objective Metrics → Variable Optimization → Automatic Selection
```
**Risk**: Variable optimization quality depends on evaluation sophistication
**Mitigation**: Ensure evaluation system is robust before variable integration

#### Chain 3: Streaming → Real-time Variable Optimization
```
GenStage Integration → Streaming Evaluation → Real-time Variable Adjustment → Adaptive Systems
```
**Risk**: Real-time optimization requires streaming infrastructure
**Mitigation**: Implement streaming early in Phase 1

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### 🧪 Multi-Modal Testing Approach

#### Testing Per Phase
**Phase 1**: Foundation testing with comprehensive behavior validation
**Phase 2**: Variable system testing with property-based validation
**Phase 3**: End-to-end integration testing with performance validation

#### Continuous Validation
```elixir
# Required checks for each phase
mix test --include group_1 --include group_2  # Comprehensive test suite
mix dialyzer                                  # Zero warnings required
mix credo --strict                           # Code quality validation
mix format --check-formatted                 # Code formatting
```

#### Performance Benchmarking
- **Baseline**: Current DSPEx performance metrics
- **Target**: 2x Python DSPy performance for equivalent operations
- **Variable System**: Optimization time < 5 minutes for standard problems

## Risk Management & Mitigation

### 🚨 High-Risk Areas

#### 1. Variable System Complexity
**Risk**: Variable abstraction too complex, impacts performance
**Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate based on real usage
**Fallback**: Implement simpler grid-search-only version first

#### 2. Integration Point Conflicts
**Risk**: Variable system conflicts with existing architecture
**Mitigation**: Use adapter pattern, maintain backward compatibility
**Fallback**: Implement variable system as optional add-on

#### 3. Performance Degradation
**Risk**: Comprehensive integration slows down basic operations
**Mitigation**: Profile continuously, optimize hot paths
**Fallback**: Make advanced features opt-in

#### 4. Scope Creep
**Risk**: Variable system requirements grow beyond original scope
**Mitigation**: Strict scope control, defer advanced features to Phase 4
**Fallback**: Ship basic variable system, iterate in subsequent releases
