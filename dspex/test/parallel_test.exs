# CodeAct

CodeAct is a DSPy module that combines code generation with tool execution to solve problems. It generates Python code snippets that use provided tools and the Python standard library to accomplish tasks.

## Basic Usage

Here's a simple example of using CodeAct:

```python
import dspy
from dspy.predict import CodeAct

# Define a simple tool function
def factorial(n: int) -> int:
    """Calculate the factorial of a number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n-1)

# Create a CodeAct instance
act = CodeAct("n->factorial_result", tools=[factorial])

# Use the CodeAct instance
result = act(n=5)
print(result) # Will calculate factorial(5) = 120
```

## How It Works

CodeAct operates in an iterative manner:

1. Takes input parameters and available tools
2. Generates Python code snippets that use these tools
3. Executes the code using a Python sandbox
4. Collects the output and determines if the task is complete
5. Answer the original question based on the collected information

## ⚠️ Limitations

### Only accepts pure functions as tools (no callable objects)

The following example does not work due to the usage of a callable object.

```python
# ❌ NG
class Add():
    def __call__(self, a: int, b: int):
        return a + b

dspy.CodeAct("question -> answer", tools=[Add()])
```

### External libraries cannot be used

The following example does not work due to the usage of the external library `numpy`.

```python
# ❌ NG
import numpy as np

def exp(i: int):
    return np.exp(i)

dspy.CodeAct("question -> answer", tools=[exp])
```

### All dependent functions need to be passed to `CodeAct`

Functions that depend on other functions or classes not passed to `CodeAct` cannot be used. The following example does not work because the tool functions depend on other functions or classes that are not passed to `CodeAct`, such as `Profile` or `secret_function`.

```python
# ❌ NG
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Profile(BaseModel):
    name: str
    age: int

def age(profile: Profile):
    return

def parent_function():
    print("Hi!")

def child_function():
    parent_function()

dspy.CodeAct("question -> answer", tools=[age, child_function])
```

Instead, the following example works since all necessary tool functions are passed to `CodeAct`:

```python
# ✅ OK

def parent_function():
    print("Hi!")

def child_function():
    parent_function()

dspy.CodeAct("question -> answer", tools=[parent_function, child_function])
```

# dspy.MIPROv2

`MIPROv2` (<u>M</u>ultiprompt <u>I</u>nstruction <u>PR</u>oposal <u>O</u>ptimizer Version 2) is an prompt optimizer capable of optimizing both instructions and few-shot examples jointly. It does this by bootstrapping few-shot example candidates, proposing instructions grounded in different dynamics of the task, and finding an optimized combination of these options using Bayesian Optimization. It can be used for optimizing few-shot examples & instructions jointly, or just instructions for 0-shot optimization.

## Example Usage

The program below shows optimizing a math program with MIPROv2

```python
import dspy
from dspy.datasets.gsm8k import GSM8K, gsm8k_metric

# Import the optimizer
from dspy.teleprompt import MIPROv2

# Initialize the LM
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)

# Initialize optimizer
teleprompter = MIPROv2(
    metric=gsm8k_metric,
    auto="medium", # Can choose between light, medium, and heavy optimization runs
)

# Optimize program
print(f"Optimizing program with MIPROv2...")
optimized_program = teleprompter.compile(
    dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer"),
    trainset=gsm8k.train,
    requires_permission_to_run=False,
)

# Save optimize program for future use
optimized_program.save(f"optimized.json")
```

## How `MIPROv2` works

At a high level, `MIPROv2` works by creating both few-shot examples and new instructions for each predictor in your LM program, and then searching over these using Bayesian Optimization to find the best combination of these variables for your program.  If you want a visual explanation check out this [twitter thread](https://x.com/michaelryan207/status/1804189184988713065).

These steps are broken down in more detail below:

1) **Bootstrap Few-Shot Examples**: Randomly samples examples from your training set, and run them through your LM program. If the output from the program is correct for this example, it is kept as a valid few-shot example candidate. Otherwise, we try another example until we've curated the specified amount of few-shot example candidates. This step creates `num_candidates` sets of `max_bootstrapped_demos` bootstrapped examples and `max_labeled_demos` basic examples sampled from the training set.

2) **Propose Instruction Candidates**. The instruction proposer includes (1) a generated summary of properties of the training dataset, (2) a generated summary of your LM program's code and the specific predictor that an instruction is being generated for, (3) the previously bootstrapped few-shot examples to show reference inputs / outputs for a given predictor and (4) a randomly sampled tip for generation (i.e. "be creative", "be concise", etc.) to help explore the feature space of potential instructions.  This context is provided to a `prompt_model` which writes high quality instruction candidates.

3) **Find an Optimized Combination of Few-Shot Examples & Instructions**. Finally, we use Bayesian Optimization to choose which combinations of instructions and demonstrations work best for each predictor in our program. This works by running a series of `num_trials` trials, where a new set of prompts are evaluated over our validation set at each trial. The new set of prompts are only evaluated on a minibatch of size `minibatch_size` at each trial (when `minibatch`=`True`). The best averaging set of prompts is then evalauted on the full validation set every `minibatch_full_eval_steps`. At the end of the optimization process, the LM program with the set of prompts that performed best on the full validation set is returned.

For those interested in more details, more information on `MIPROv2` along with a study on `MIPROv2` compared with other DSPy optimizers can be found in [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695).

# Data

DSPy is a machine learning framework, so working in it involves training sets, development sets, and test sets. For each example in your data, we distinguish typically between three types of values: the inputs, the intermediate labels, and the final label. You can use DSPy effectively without any intermediate or final labels, but you will need at least a few example inputs.


## DSPy `Example` objects

The core data type for data in DSPy is `Example`. You will use **Examples** to represent items in your training set and test set.

DSPy **Examples** are similar to Python `dict`s but have a few useful utilities. Your DSPy modules will return values of the type `Prediction`, which is a special sub-class of `Example`.

When you use DSPy, you will do a lot of evaluation and optimization runs. Your individual datapoints will be of type `Example`:

```python
qa_pair = dspy.Example(question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.")

print(qa_pair)
print(qa_pair.question)
print(qa_pair.answer)
```
**Output:**
```text
Example({'question': 'This is a question?', 'answer': 'This is an answer.'}) (input_keys=None)
This is a question?
This is an answer.
```

Examples can have any field keys and any value types, though usually values are strings.

```text
object = Example(field1=value1, field2=value2, field3=value3, ...)
```

You can now express your training set for example as:

```python
trainset = [dspy.Example(report="LONG REPORT 1", summary="short summary 1"), ...]
```


### Specifying Input Keys

In traditional ML, there are separated "inputs" and "labels".

In DSPy, the `Example` objects have a `with_inputs()` method, which can mark specific fields as inputs. (The rest are just metadata or labels.)

```python
# Single Input.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question"))

# Multiple Inputs; be careful about marking your labels as inputs unless you mean it.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question", "answer"))
```

Values can be accessed using the `.`(dot) operator. You can access the value of key `name` in defined object `Example(name="John Doe", job="sleep")` through `object.name`.

To access or exclude certain keys, use `inputs()` and `labels()` methods to return new Example objects containing only input or non-input keys, respectively.

```python
article_summary = dspy.Example(article= "This is an article.", summary= "This is a summary.").with_inputs("article")

input_key_only = article_summary.inputs()
non_input_key_only = article_summary.labels()

print("Example object with Input fields only:", input_key_only)
print("Example object with Non-Input fields only:", non_input_key_only)
```

**Output**
```
Example object with Input fields only: Example({'article': 'This is an article.'}) (input_keys=None)
Example object with Non-Input fields only: Example({'summary': 'This is a summary.'}) (input_keys=None)
```

<!-- ## Loading Dataset from sources

One of the most convenient way to import datasets in DSPy is by using `DataLoader`. The first step is to declare an object, this object can then be used to call utilities to load datasets in different formats:

```python
from dspy.datasets import DataLoader

dl = DataLoader()
```

For most dataset formats, it's quite straightforward you pass the file path to the corresponding method of the format and you'll get the list of `Example` for the dataset in return:

```python
import pandas as pd

csv_dataset = dl.from_csv(
    "sample_dataset.csv",
    fields=("instruction", "context", "response"),
    input_keys=("instruction", "context")
)

json_dataset = dl.from_json(
    "sample_dataset.json",
    fields=("instruction", "context", "response"),
    input_keys=("instruction", "context")
)

parquet_dataset = dl.from_parquet(
    "sample_dataset.parquet",
    fields=("instruction", "context", "response"),
    input_keys=("instruction", "context")
)

pandas_dataset = dl.from_pandas(
    pd.read_csv("sample_dataset.csv"),    # DataFrame
    fields=("instruction", "context", "response"),
    input_keys=("instruction", "context")
)
```

These are some formats that `DataLoader` supports to load from file directly. In the backend, most of these methods leverage the `load_dataset` method from `datasets` library to load these formats. But when working with text data you often use HuggingFace datasets, in order to import HF datasets in list of `Example` format we can use `from_huggingface` method:

```python
blog_alpaca = dl.from_huggingface(
    "intertwine-expel/expel-blog",
    input_keys=("title",)
)
```

You can access the splits of the dataset by accessing the corresponding key:

```python
train_split = blog_alpaca['train']

# Since this is the only split in the dataset we can split this into
# train and test split ourselves by slicing or sampling 75 rows from the train
# split for testing.
testset = train_split[:75]
trainset = train_split[75:]
```

The way you load a HuggingFace dataset using `load_dataset` is exactly how you load data it via `from_huggingface` as well. This includes passing specific splits, subsplits, read instructions, etc. For code snippets, you can refer to the [cheatsheet snippets](/cheatsheet/#dspy-dataloaders) for loading from HF. -->

# Metrics

DSPy is a machine learning framework, so you must think about your **automatic metrics** for evaluation (to track your progress) and optimization (so DSPy can make your programs more effective).


## What is a metric and how do I define a metric for my task?

A metric is just a function that will take examples from your data and the output of your system and return a score that quantifies how good the output is. What makes outputs from your system good or bad?

For simple tasks, this could be just "accuracy" or "exact match" or "F1 score". This may be the case for simple classification or short-form QA tasks.

However, for most applications, your system will output long-form outputs. There, your metric should probably be a smaller DSPy program that checks multiple properties of the output (quite possibly using AI feedback from LMs).

Getting this right on the first try is unlikely, but you should start with something simple and iterate.


## Simple metrics

A DSPy metric is just a function in Python that takes `example` (e.g., from your training or dev set) and the output `pred` from your DSPy program, and outputs a `float` (or `int` or `bool`) score.

Your metric should also accept an optional third argument called `trace`. You can ignore this for a moment, but it will enable some powerful tricks if you want to use your metric for optimization.

Here's a simple example of a metric that's comparing `example.answer` and `pred.answer`. This particular metric will return a `bool`.

```python
def validate_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    return example.answer.lower() == pred.answer.lower()
```

Some people find these utilities (built-in) convenient:

- `dspy.evaluate.metrics.answer_exact_match`
- `dspy.evaluate.metrics.answer_passage_match`

Your metrics could be more complex, e.g. check for multiple properties. The metric below will return a `float` if `trace is None` (i.e., if it's used for evaluation or optimization), and will return a `bool` otherwise (i.e., if it's used to bootstrap demonstrations).

```python
def validate_context_and_answer(example, pred, trace=None):
    # check the gold label and the predicted answer are the same
    answer_match = example.answer.lower() == pred.answer.lower()

    # check the predicted answer comes from one of the retrieved contexts
    context_match = any((pred.answer.lower() in c) for c in pred.context)

    if trace is None: # if we're doing evaluation or optimization
        return (answer_match + context_match) / 2.0
    else: # if we're doing bootstrapping, i.e. self-generating good demonstrations of each step
        return answer_match and context_match
```

Defining a good metric is an iterative process, so doing some initial evaluations and looking at your data and outputs is key.


## Evaluation

Once you have a metric, you can run evaluations in a simple Python loop.

```python
scores = []
for x in devset:
    pred = program(**x.inputs())
    score = metric(x, pred)
    scores.append(score)
```

If you need some utilities, you can also use the built-in `Evaluate` utility. It can help with things like parallel evaluation (multiple threads) or showing you a sample of inputs/outputs and the metric scores.

```python
from dspy.evaluate import Evaluate

# Set up the evaluator, which can be re-used in your code.
evaluator = Evaluate(devset=YOUR_DEVSET, num_threads=1, display_progress=True, display_table=5)

# Launch evaluation.
evaluator(YOUR_PROGRAM, metric=YOUR_METRIC)
```


## Intermediate: Using AI feedback for your metric

For most applications, your system will output long-form outputs, so your metric should check multiple dimensions of the output using AI feedback from LMs.

This simple signature could come in handy.

```python
# Define the signature for automatic assessments.
class Assess(dspy.Signature):
    """Assess the quality of a tweet along the specified dimension."""

    assessed_text = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_question = dspy.InputField()
    assessment_answer: bool = dspy.OutputField()
```

For example, below is a simple metric that checks a generated tweet (1) answers a given question correctly and (2) whether it's also engaging. We also check that (3) `len(tweet) <= 280` characters.

```python
def metric(gold, pred, trace=None):
    question, answer, tweet = gold.question, gold.answer, pred.output

    engaging = "Does the assessed text make for a self-contained, engaging tweet?"
    correct = f"The text should answer `{question}` with `{answer}`. Does the assessed text contain this answer?"

    correct =  dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=tweet, assessment_question=correct)
    engaging = dspy.Predict(Assess)(assessed_text=tweet, assessment_question=engaging)

    correct, engaging = [m.assessment_answer for m in [correct, engaging]]
    score = (correct + engaging) if correct and (len(tweet) <= 280) else 0

    if trace is not None: return score >= 2
    return score / 2.0
```

When compiling, `trace is not None`, and we want to be strict about judging things, so we will only return `True` if `score >= 2`. Otherwise, we return a score out of 1.0 (i.e., `score / 2.0`).


## Advanced: Using a DSPy program as your metric

If your metric is itself a DSPy program, one of the most powerful ways to iterate is to compile (optimize) your metric itself. That's usually easy because the output of the metric is usually a simple value (e.g., a score out of 5) so the metric's metric is easy to define and optimize by collecting a few examples.



### Advanced: Accessing the `trace`

When your metric is used during evaluation runs, DSPy will not try to track the steps of your program.

But during compiling (optimization), DSPy will trace your LM calls. The trace will contain inputs/outputs to each DSPy predictor and you can leverage that to validate intermediate steps for optimization.


```python
def validate_hops(example, pred, trace=None):
    hops = [example.question] + [outputs.query for *_, outputs in trace if 'query' in outputs]

    if max([len(h) for h in hops]) > 100: return False
    if any(dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match_str(hops[idx], hops[:idx], frac=0.8) for idx in range(2, len(hops))): return False

    return True
```

# Evaluation in DSPy

Once you have an initial system, it's time to **collect an initial development set** so you can refine it more systematically. Even 20 input examples of your task can be useful, though 200 goes a long way. Depending on your _metric_, you either just need inputs and no labels at all, or you need inputs and the _final_ outputs of your system. (You almost never need labels for the intermediate steps in your program in DSPy.) You can probably find datasets that are adjacent to your task on, say, HuggingFace datasets or in a naturally occuring source like StackExchange. If there's data whose licenses are permissive enough, we suggest you use them. Otherwise, you can label a few examples by hand or start deploying a demo of your system and collect initial data that way.

Next, you should **define your DSPy metric**. What makes outputs from your system good or bad? Invest in defining metrics and improving them incrementally over time; it's hard to consistently improve what you aren't able to define. A metric is a function that takes examples from your data and takes the output of your system, and returns a score. For simple tasks, this could be just "accuracy", e.g. for simple classification or short-form QA tasks. For most applications, your system will produce long-form outputs, so your metric will be a smaller DSPy program that checks multiple properties of the output. Getting this right on the first try is unlikely: start with something simple and iterate.

Now that you have some data and a metric, run development evaluations on your pipeline designs to understand their tradeoffs. Look at the outputs and the metric scores. This will probably allow you to spot any major issues, and it will define a baseline for your next steps.

# DSPy Optimizers (formerly Teleprompters)


A **DSPy optimizer** is an algorithm that can tune the parameters of a DSPy program (i.e., the prompts and/or the LM weights) to maximize the metrics you specify, like accuracy.


A typical DSPy optimizer takes three things:

- Your **DSPy program**. This may be a single module (e.g., `dspy.Predict`) or a complex multi-module program.

- Your **metric**. This is a function that evaluates the output of your program, and assigns it a score (higher is better).

- A few **training inputs**. This may be very small (i.e., only 5 or 10 examples) and incomplete (only inputs to your program, without any labels).

If you happen to have a lot of data, DSPy can leverage that. But you can start small and get strong results.

**Note:** Formerly called teleprompters. We are making an official name update, which will be reflected throughout the library and documentation.


## What does a DSPy Optimizer tune? How does it tune them?

Different optimizers in DSPy will tune your program's quality by **synthesizing good few-shot examples** for every module, like `dspy.BootstrapRS`,<sup>[1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03714)</sup> **proposing and intelligently exploring better natural-language instructions** for every prompt, like `dspy.MIPROv2`,<sup>[2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11695)</sup> and **building datasets for your modules and using them to finetune the LM weights** in your system, like `dspy.BootstrapFinetune`.<sup>[3](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10930)</sup>

??? "What's an example of a DSPy optimizer? How do different optimizers work?"

    Take the `dspy.MIPROv2` optimizer as an example. First, MIPRO starts with the **bootstrapping stage**. It takes your program, which may be unoptimized at this point, and runs it many times across different inputs to collect traces of input/output behavior for each one of your modules. It filters these traces to keep only those that appear in trajectories scored highly by your metric. Second, MIPRO enters its **grounded proposal stage**. It previews your DSPy program's code, your data, and traces from running your program, and uses them to draft many potential instructions for every prompt in your program. Third, MIPRO launches the **discrete search stage**. It samples mini-batches from your training set, proposes a combination of instructions and traces to use for constructing every prompt in the pipeline, and evaluates the candidate program on the mini-batch. Using the resulting score, MIPRO updates a surrogate model that helps the proposals get better over time.

    One thing that makes DSPy optimizers so powerful is that they can be composed. You can run `dspy.MIPROv2` and use the produced program as an input to `dspy.MIPROv2` again or, say, to `dspy.BootstrapFinetune` to get better results. This is partly the essence of `dspy.BetterTogether`. Alternatively, you can run the optimizer and then extract the top-5 candidate programs and build a `dspy.Ensemble` of them. This allows you to scale _inference-time compute_ (e.g., ensembles) as well as DSPy's unique _pre-inference time compute_ (i.e., optimization budget) in highly systematic ways.



## What DSPy Optimizers are currently available?

Optimizers can be accessed via `from dspy.teleprompt import *`.

### Automatic Few-Shot Learning

These optimizers extend the signature by automatically generating and including **optimized** examples within the prompt sent to the model, implementing few-shot learning.

1. [**`LabeledFewShot`**](/api/optimizers/LabeledFewShot): Simply constructs few-shot examples (demos) from provided labeled input and output data points.  Requires `k` (number of examples for the prompt) and `trainset` to randomly select `k` examples from.

2. [**`BootstrapFewShot`**](/api/optimizers/BootstrapFewshot): Uses a `teacher` module (which defaults to your program) to generate complete demonstrations for every stage of your program, along with labeled examples in `trainset`. Parameters include `max_labeled_demos` (the number of demonstrations randomly selected from the `trainset`) and `max_bootstrapped_demos` (the number of additional examples generated by the `teacher`). The bootstrapping process employs the metric to validate demonstrations, including only those that pass the metric in the "compiled" prompt. Advanced: Supports using a `teacher` program that is a *different* DSPy program that has compatible structure, for harder tasks.

3. [**`BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`**](/api/optimizers/BootstrapFewshotWithRandomSearch): Applies `BootstrapFewShot` several times with random search over generated demonstrations, and selects the best program over the optimization. Parameters mirror those of `BootstrapFewShot`, with the addition of `num_candidate_programs`, which specifies the number of random programs evaluated over the optimization, including candidates of the uncompiled program, `LabeledFewShot` optimized program, `BootstrapFewShot` compiled program with unshuffled examples and `num_candidate_programs` of `BootstrapFewShot` compiled programs with randomized example sets.

4. [**`KNNFewShot`**](/api/optimizers/KNNFewShot/). Uses k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to find the nearest training example demonstrations for a given input example. These nearest neighbor demonstrations are then used as the trainset for the BootstrapFewShot optimization process.


### Automatic Instruction Optimization

These optimizers produce optimal instructions for the prompt and, in the case of MIPROv2 can also optimize the set of few-shot demonstrations.

5. [**`COPRO`**](/api/optimizers/COPRO): Generates and refines new instructions for each step, and optimizes them with coordinate ascent (hill-climbing using the metric function and the `trainset`). Parameters include `depth` which is the number of iterations of prompt improvement the optimizer runs over.

6. [**`MIPROv2`**](/api/optimizers/MIPROv2): Generates instructions *and* few-shot examples in each step. The instruction generation is data-aware and demonstration-aware. Uses Bayesian Optimization to effectively search over the space of generation instructions/demonstrations across your modules.


### Automatic Finetuning

This optimizer is used to fine-tune the underlying LLM(s).

7. [**`BootstrapFinetune`**](/api/optimizers/BootstrapFinetune): Distills a prompt-based DSPy program into weight updates. The output is a DSPy program that has the same steps, but where each step is conducted by a finetuned model instead of a prompted LM.


### Program Transformations

8. [**`Ensemble`**](/api/optimizers/Ensemble): Ensembles a set of DSPy programs and either uses the full set or randomly samples a subset into a single program.


## Which optimizer should I use?

Ultimately, finding the ‘right’ optimizer to use & the best configuration for your task will require experimentation. Success in DSPy is still an iterative process - getting the best performance on your task will require you to explore and iterate.

That being said, here's the general guidance on getting started:

- If you have **very few examples** (around 10), start with `BootstrapFewShot`.
- If you have **more data** (50 examples or more), try  `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`.
- If you prefer to do **instruction optimization only** (i.e. you want to keep your prompt 0-shot), use `MIPROv2` [configured for 0-shot optimization to optimize](/deep-dive/optimizers/miprov2#optimizing-instructions-only-with-miprov2-0-shot).
- If you’re willing to use more inference calls to perform **longer optimization runs** (e.g. 40 trials or more), and have enough data (e.g. 200 examples or more to prevent overfitting) then try `MIPROv2`.
- If you have been able to use one of these with a large LM (e.g., 7B parameters or above) and need a very **efficient program**, finetune a small LM for your task with `BootstrapFinetune`.

## How do I use an optimizer?

They all share this general interface, with some differences in the keyword arguments (hyperparameters). Detailed documentation for key optimizers can be found [here](/deep-dive/optimizers/vfrs), and a full list can be found [here](https://dspy.ai/api/optimizers/BetterTogether/).

Let's see this with the most common one, `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`.

```python
from dspy.teleprompt import BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch

# Set up the optimizer: we want to "bootstrap" (i.e., self-generate) 8-shot examples of your program's steps.
# The optimizer will repeat this 10 times (plus some initial attempts) before selecting its best attempt on the devset.
config = dict(max_bootstrapped_demos=4, max_labeled_demos=4, num_candidate_programs=10, num_threads=4)

teleprompter = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(metric=YOUR_METRIC_HERE, **config)
optimized_program = teleprompter.compile(YOUR_PROGRAM_HERE, trainset=YOUR_TRAINSET_HERE)
```


!!! info "Getting Started III: Optimizing the LM prompts or weights in DSPy programs"
    A typical simple optimization run costs on the order of $2 USD and takes around ten minutes, but be careful when running optimizers with very large LMs or very large datasets.
    Optimizer runs can cost as little as a few cents or up to tens of dollars, depending on your LM, dataset, and configuration.

    === "Optimizing prompts for a ReAct agent"
        This is a minimal but fully runnable example of setting up a `dspy.ReAct` agent that answers questions via
        search from Wikipedia and then optimizing it using `dspy.MIPROv2` in the cheap `light` mode on 500
        question-answer pairs sampled from the `HotPotQA` dataset.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA

        dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini'))

        def search(query: str) -> list[str]:
            """Retrieves abstracts from Wikipedia."""
            results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=3)
            return [x['text'] for x in results]

        trainset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in HotPotQA(train_seed=2024, train_size=500).train]
        react = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer", tools=[search])

        tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match, auto="light", num_threads=24)
        optimized_react = tp.compile(react, trainset=trainset)
        ```

        An informal run similar to this on DSPy 2.5.29 raises ReAct's score from 24% to 51%.

    === "Optimizing prompts for RAG"
        Given a retrieval index to `search`, your favorite `dspy.LM`, and a small `trainset` of questions and ground-truth responses, the following code snippet can optimize your RAG system with long outputs against the built-in `dspy.SemanticF1` metric, which is implemented as a DSPy module.

        ```python linenums="1"
        class RAG(dspy.Module):
            def __init__(self, num_docs=5):
                self.num_docs = num_docs
                self.respond = dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response')

            def forward(self, question):
                context = search(question, k=self.num_docs)   # not defined in this snippet, see link above
                return self.respond(context=context, question=question)

        tp = dspy.MIPROv2(metric=dspy.SemanticF1(), auto="medium", num_threads=24)
        optimized_rag = tp.compile(RAG(), trainset=trainset, max_bootstrapped_demos=2, max_labeled_demos=2)
        ```

        For a complete RAG example that you can run, start this [tutorial](/tutorials/rag/). It improves the quality of a RAG system over a subset of StackExchange communities from 53% to 61%.

    === "Optimizing weights for Classification"
        This is a minimal but fully runnable example of setting up a `dspy.ChainOfThought` module that classifies
        short texts into one of 77 banking labels and then using `dspy.BootstrapFinetune` with 2000 text-label pairs
        from the `Banking77` to finetune the weights of GPT-4o-mini for this task. We use the variant
        `dspy.ChainOfThoughtWithHint`, which takes an optional `hint` at bootstrapping time, to maximize the utility of
        the training data. Naturally, hints are not available at test time. More can be found in this [tutorial](/tutorials/classification_finetuning/).

        kwargs = dict(fields=("text", "label"), input_keys=("text",), split="train", trust_remote_code=True)

        # Load the first 2000 examples from the dataset, and assign a hint to each *training* example.
        trainset = [
            dspy.Example(x, hint=CLASSES[x.label], label=CLASSES[x.label]).with_inputs("text", "hint")
            for x in DataLoader().from_huggingface(dataset_name="PolyAI/banking77", **kwargs)[:2000]
        ]
        random.Random(0).shuffle(trainset)
        ```
        </details>

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM('gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18'))

        # Define the DSPy module for classification. It will use the hint at training time, if available.
        signature = dspy.Signature("text -> label").with_updated_fields('label', type_=Literal[tuple(CLASSES)])
        classify = dspy.ChainOfThoughtWithHint(signature)

        # Optimize via BootstrapFinetune.
        optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFinetune(metric=(lambda x, y, trace=None: x.label == y.label), num_threads=24)
        optimized = optimizer.compile(classify, trainset=trainset)

        optimized(text="What does a pending cash withdrawal mean?")
        ```

        **Possible Output (from the last line):**
        ```text
        Prediction(
            reasoning='A pending cash withdrawal indicates that a request to withdraw cash has been initiated but has not yet been completed or processed. This status means that the transaction is still in progress and the funds have not yet been deducted from the account or made available to the user.',
            label='pending_cash_withdrawal'
        )
        ```

        An informal run similar to this on DSPy 2.5.29 raises GPT-4o-mini's score 66% to 87%.


## Saving and loading optimizer output

After running a program through an optimizer, it's useful to also save it. At a later point, a program can be loaded from a file and used for inference. For this, the `load` and `save` methods can be used.

```python
optimized_program.save(YOUR_SAVE_PATH)
```

The resulting file is in plain-text JSON format. It contains all the parameters and steps in the source program. You can always read it and see what the optimizer generated. You can add `save_field_meta` to additionally save the list of fields with the keys, `name`, `field_type`, `description`, and `prefix` with: `optimized_program.save(YOUR_SAVE_PATH, save_field_meta=True).


To load a program from a file, you can instantiate an object from that class and then call the load method on it.

```python
loaded_program = YOUR_PROGRAM_CLASS()
loaded_program.load(path=YOUR_SAVE_PATH)
```
</file>

# Optimization in DSPy

Once you have a system and a way to evaluate it, you can use DSPy optimizers to tune the prompts or weights in your program. Now it's useful to expand your data collection effort into building a training set and a held-out test set, in addition to the development set you've been using for exploration. For the training set (and its subset, validation set), you can often get substantial value out of 30 examples, but aim for at least 300 examples. Some optimizers accept a `trainset` only. Others ask for a `trainset` and a `valset`. For prompt optimizers, we suggest starting with a 20% split for training and 80% for validation, which is often the _opposite_ of what one does for DNNs.

After your first few optimization runs, you are either very happy with everything or you've made a lot of progress but you don't like something about the final program or the metric. At this point, go back to step 1 (Programming in DSPy) and revisit the major questions. Did you define your task well? Do you need to collect (or find online) more data for your problem? Do you want to update your metric? And do you want to use a more sophisticated optimizer? Do you need to consider advanced features like DSPy Assertions? Or, perhaps most importantly, do you want to add some more complexity or steps in your DSPy program itself? Do you want to use multiple optimizers in a sequence?

Iterative development is key. DSPy gives you the pieces to do that incrementally: iterating on your data, your program structure, your assertions, your metric, and your optimization steps. Optimizing complex LM programs is an entirely new paradigm that only exists in DSPy at the time of writing (update: there are now numerous DSPy extension frameworks, so this part is no longer true :-), so naturally the norms around what to do are still emerging. If you need help, we recently created a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/XCGy2WDCQB) for the community.

# DSPy Assertions

!!! warning "This page is outdated and may not be fully accurate in DSPy 2.5"


## Introduction

Language models (LMs) have transformed how we interact with machine learning, offering vast capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. However, ensuring these models adhere to domain-specific constraints remains a challenge. Despite the growth of techniques like fine-tuning or “prompt engineering”, these approaches are extremely tedious and rely on heavy, manual hand-waving to guide the LMs in adhering to specific constraints. Even DSPy's modularity of programming prompting pipelines lacks mechanisms to effectively and automatically enforce these constraints.

To address this, we introduce DSPy Assertions, a feature within the DSPy framework designed to automate the enforcement of computational constraints on LMs. DSPy Assertions empower developers to guide LMs towards desired outcomes with minimal manual intervention, enhancing the reliability, predictability, and correctness of LM outputs.

### dspy.Assert and dspy.Suggest API

We introduce two primary constructs within DSPy Assertions:

- **`dspy.Assert`**:
  - **Parameters**:
    - `constraint (bool)`: Outcome of Python-defined boolean validation check.
    - `msg (Optional[str])`: User-defined error message providing feedback or correction guidance.
    - `backtrack (Optional[module])`: Specifies target module for retry attempts upon constraint failure. The default backtracking module is the last module before the assertion.
  - **Behavior**: Initiates retry  upon failure, dynamically adjusting the pipeline's execution. If failures persist, it halts execution and raises a `dspy.AssertionError`.

- **`dspy.Suggest`**:
  - **Parameters**: Similar to `dspy.Assert`.
  - **Behavior**: Encourages self-refinement through retries without enforcing hard stops. Logs failures after maximum backtracking attempts and continues execution.

- **dspy.Assert vs. Python Assertions**: Unlike conventional Python `assert` statements that terminate the program upon failure, `dspy.Assert` conducts a sophisticated retry mechanism, allowing the pipeline to adjust.

Specifically, when a constraint is not met:

- Backtracking Mechanism: An under-the-hood backtracking is initiated, offering the model a chance to self-refine and proceed, which is done through signature modification.
- Dynamic Signature Modification: internally modifying your DSPy program’s Signature by adding the following fields:
    - Past Output: your model's past output that did not pass the validation_fn
    - Instruction: your user-defined feedback message on what went wrong and what possibly to fix

If the error continues past the `max_backtracking_attempts`, then `dspy.Assert` will halt the pipeline execution, alerting you with an `dspy.AssertionError`. This ensures your program doesn't continue executing with “bad” LM behavior and immediately highlights sample failure outputs for user assessment.

- **dspy.Suggest vs. dspy.Assert**: `dspy.Suggest` on the other hand offers a softer approach. It maintains the same retry backtracking as `dspy.Assert` but instead serves as a gentle nudger. If the model outputs cannot pass the model constraints after the `max_backtracking_attempts`, `dspy.Suggest` will log the persistent failure and continue execution of the program on the rest of the data. This ensures the LM pipeline works in a "best-effort" manner without halting execution.

- **`dspy.Suggest`** statements are best utilized as "helpers" during the evaluation phase, offering guidance and potential corrections without halting the pipeline.
- **`dspy.Assert`** statements are recommended during the development stage as "checkers" to ensure the LM behaves as expected, providing a robust mechanism for identifying and addressing errors early in the development cycle.


## Use Case: Including Assertions in DSPy Programs

We start with using an example of a multi-hop QA SimplifiedBaleen pipeline as defined in the intro walkthrough.

```python
class SimplifiedBaleen(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, passages_per_hop=2, max_hops=2):
        super().__init__()

        self.generate_query = [dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateSearchQuery) for _ in range(max_hops)]
        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages_per_hop)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)
        self.max_hops = max_hops

    def forward(self, question):
        context = []
        prev_queries = [question]

        for hop in range(self.max_hops):
            query = self.generate_query[hop](context=context, question=question).query
            prev_queries.append(query)
            passages = self.retrieve(query).passages
            context = deduplicate(context + passages)

        pred = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        pred = dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=pred.answer)
        return pred

baleen = SimplifiedBaleen()

baleen(question = "Which award did Gary Zukav's first book receive?")
```

To include DSPy Assertions, we simply define our validation functions and declare our assertions following the respective model generation.

For this use case, suppose we want to impose the following constraints:
    1. Length - each query should be less than 100 characters
    2. Uniqueness - each generated query should differ from previously-generated queries.

We can define these validation checks as boolean functions:

```python
#simplistic boolean check for query length
len(query) <= 100

#Python function for validating distinct queries
def validate_query_distinction_local(previous_queries, query):
    """check if query is distinct from previous queries"""
    if previous_queries == []:
        return True
    if dspy.evaluate.answer_exact_match_str(query, previous_queries, frac=0.8):
        return False
    return True
```

We can declare these validation checks through `dspy.Suggest` statements (as we want to test the program in a best-effort demonstration). We want to keep these after the query generation `query = self.generate_query[hop](context=context, question=question).query`.

```python
dspy.Suggest(
    len(query) <= 100,
    "Query should be short and less than 100 characters",
    target_module=self.generate_query
)

dspy.Suggest(
    validate_query_distinction_local(prev_queries, query),
    "Query should be distinct from: "
    + "; ".join(f"{i+1}) {q}" for i, q in enumerate(prev_queries)),
    target_module=self.generate_query
)
```

It is recommended to define a program with assertions separately than your original program if you are doing comparative evaluation for the effect of assertions. If not, feel free to set Assertions away!

Let's take a look at how the SimplifiedBaleen program will look with Assertions included:

```python
class SimplifiedBaleenAssertions(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, passages_per_hop=2, max_hops=2):
        super().__init__()
        self.generate_query = [dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateSearchQuery) for _ in range(max_hops)]
        self.retrieve = dspy.Retrieve(k=passages_per_hop)
        self.generate_answer = dspy.ChainOfThought(GenerateAnswer)
        self.max_hops = max_hops

    def forward(self, question):
        context = []
        prev_queries = [question]

        for hop in range(self.max_hops):
            query = self.generate_query[hop](context=context, question=question).query

            dspy.Suggest(
                len(query) <= 100,
                "Query should be short and less than 100 characters",
                target_module=self.generate_query
            )

            dspy.Suggest(
                validate_query_distinction_local(prev_queries, query),
                "Query should be distinct from: "
                + "; ".join(f"{i+1}) {q}" for i, q in enumerate(prev_queries)),
                target_module=self.generate_query
            )

            prev_queries.append(query)
            passages = self.retrieve(query).passages
            context = deduplicate(context + passages)

        if all_queries_distinct(prev_queries):
            self.passed_suggestions += 1

        pred = self.generate_answer(context=context, question=question)
        pred = dspy.Prediction(context=context, answer=pred.answer)
        return pred
```

Now calling programs with DSPy Assertions requires one last step, and that is transforming the program to wrap it with internal assertions backtracking and Retry logic.

```python
from dspy.primitives.assertions import assert_transform_module, backtrack_handler

baleen_with_assertions = assert_transform_module(SimplifiedBaleenAssertions(), backtrack_handler)

# backtrack_handler is parameterized over a few settings for the backtracking mechanism
# To change the number of max retry attempts, you can do
baleen_with_assertions_retry_once = assert_transform_module(SimplifiedBaleenAssertions(),
    functools.partial(backtrack_handler, max_backtracks=1))
```

Alternatively, you can also directly call `activate_assertions` on the program with `dspy.Assert/Suggest` statements using the default backtracking mechanism (`max_backtracks=2`):

```python
baleen_with_assertions = SimplifiedBaleenAssertions().activate_assertions()
```

Now let's take a look at the internal LM backtracking by inspecting the history of the LM query generations. Here we see that when a query fails to pass the validation check of being less than 100 characters, its internal `GenerateSearchQuery` signature is dynamically modified during the backtracking+Retry process to include the past query and the corresponding user-defined instruction: `"Query should be short and less than 100 characters"`.

## Assertion-Driven Optimizations

DSPy Assertions work with optimizations that DSPy offers, particularly with `BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch`, including the following settings:

- Compilation with Assertions
    This includes assertion-driven example bootstrapping and counterexample bootstrapping during compilation. The teacher model for bootstrapping few-shot demonstrations can make use of DSPy Assertions to offer robust bootstrapped examples for the student model to learn from during inference. In this setting, the student model does not perform assertion aware optimizations (backtracking and retry) during inference.
- Compilation + Inference with Assertions
    -This includes assertion-driven optimizations in both compilation and inference. Now the teacher model offers assertion-driven examples but the student can further optimize with assertions of its own during inference time.
```python
teleprompter = BootstrapFewShotWithRandomSearch(
    metric=validate_context_and_answer_and_hops,
    max_bootstrapped_demos=max_bootstrapped_demos,
    num_candidate_programs=6,
)

#Compilation with Assertions
compiled_with_assertions_baleen = teleprompter.compile(student = baleen, teacher = baleen_with_assertions, trainset = trainset, valset = devset)

#Compilation + Inference with Assertions
compiled_baleen_with_assertions = teleprompter.compile(student=baleen_with_assertions, teacher = baleen_with_assertions, trainset=trainset, valset=devset)

# Language Models

The first step in any DSPy code is to set up your language model. For example, you can configure OpenAI's GPT-4o-mini as your default LM as follows.

```python linenums="1"
# Authenticate via `OPENAI_API_KEY` env: import os; os.environ['OPENAI_API_KEY'] = 'here'
lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini')
dspy.configure(lm=lm)
```

!!! info "A few different LMs"

    === "OpenAI"
        You can authenticate by setting the `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable or passing `api_key` below.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        lm = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', api_key='YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY')
        dspy.configure(lm=lm)
        ```

    === "Gemini (AI Studio)"
        You can authenticate by setting the GEMINI_API_KEY env variable or passing `api_key` below.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        lm = dspy.LM('gemini/gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25', api_key='GEMINI_API_KEY')
        dspy.configure(lm=lm)
        ```

    === "Anthropic"
        You can authenticate by setting the ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env variable or passing `api_key` below.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        lm = dspy.LM('anthropic/claude-3-opus-20240229', api_key='YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY')
        dspy.configure(lm=lm)
        ```

    === "Databricks"
        If you're on the Databricks platform, authentication is automatic via their SDK. If not, you can set the env variables `DATABRICKS_API_KEY` and `DATABRICKS_API_BASE`, or pass `api_key` and `api_base` below.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        lm = dspy.LM('databricks/databricks-meta-llama-3-1-70b-instruct')
        dspy.configure(lm=lm)
        ```

    === "Local LMs on a GPU server"
          First, install [SGLang](https://sgl-project.github.io/start/install.html) and launch its server with your LM.

          ```bash
          > pip install "sglang[all]"
          > pip install flashinfer -i https://flashinfer.ai/whl/cu121/torch2.4/

          > CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python -m sglang.launch_server --port 7501 --model-path meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
          ```

          Then, connect to it from your DSPy code as an OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

          ```python linenums="1"
          lm = dspy.LM("openai/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
                           api_base="http://localhost:7501/v1",  # ensure this points to your port
                           api_key="", model_type='chat')
          dspy.configure(lm=lm)
          ```

    === "Local LMs on your laptop"
          First, install [Ollama](https://github.com/ollama/ollama) and launch its server with your LM.

          ```bash
          > curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
          > ollama run llama3.2:1b
          ```

          Then, connect to it from your DSPy code.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        lm = dspy.LM('ollama_chat/llama3.2', api_base='http://localhost:11434', api_key='')
        dspy.configure(lm=lm)
        ```

    === "Other providers"
        In DSPy, you can use any of the dozens of [LLM providers supported by LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers). Simply follow their instructions for which `{PROVIDER}_API_KEY` to set and how to write pass the `{provider_name}/{model_name}` to the constructor.

        Some examples:

        - `anyscale/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1`, with `ANYSCALE_API_KEY`
        - `together_ai/togethercomputer/llama-2-70b-chat`, with `TOGETHERAI_API_KEY`
        - `sagemaker/<your-endpoint-name>`, with `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION_NAME`
        - `azure/<your_deployment_name>`, with `AZURE_API_KEY`, `AZURE_API_BASE`, `AZURE_API_VERSION`, and the optional `AZURE_AD_TOKEN` and `AZURE_API_TYPE` as environment variables. If you are initiating external models without setting environment variables, use the following:
        `lm = dspy.LM('azure/<your_deployment_name>', api_key = 'AZURE_API_KEY' , api_base = 'AZURE_API_BASE', api_version = 'AZURE_API_VERSION')`



        If your provider offers an OpenAI-compatible endpoint, just add an `openai/` prefix to your full model name.

        ```python linenums="1"
        import dspy
        lm = dspy.LM('openai/your-model-name', api_key='PROVIDER_API_KEY', api_base='YOUR_PROVIDER_URL')
        dspy.configure(lm=lm)
        ```
If you run into errors, please refer to the [LiteLLM Docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) to verify if you are using the same variable names/following the right procedure.

## Calling the LM directly.

It's easy to call the `lm` you configured above directly. This gives you a unified API and lets you benefit from utilities like automatic caching.

```python linenums="1"
lm("Say this is a test!", temperature=0.7)  # => ['This is a test!']
lm(messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Say this is a test!"}])  # => ['This is a test!']
```

## Using the LM with DSPy modules.

Idiomatic DSPy involves using _modules_, which we discuss in the next guide.

```python linenums="1"
# Define a module (ChainOfThought) and assign it a signature (return an answer, given a question).
qa = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer')

# Run with the default LM configured with `dspy.configure` above.
response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
print(response.answer)
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
The castle David Gregory inherited has 7 floors.
```

## Using multiple LMs.

You can change the default LM globally with `dspy.configure` or change it inside a block of code with `dspy.context`.

!!! tip
    Using `dspy.configure` and `dspy.context` is thread-safe!


```python linenums="1"
dspy.configure(lm=dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini'))
response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
print('GPT-4o-mini:', response.answer)

with dspy.context(lm=dspy.LM('openai/gpt-3.5-turbo')):
    response = qa(question="How many floors are in the castle David Gregory inherited?")
    print('GPT-3.5-turbo:', response.answer)
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
GPT-4o: The number of floors in the castle David Gregory inherited cannot be determined with the information provided.
GPT-3.5-turbo: The castle David Gregory inherited has 7 floors.
```

## Configuring LM generation.

For any LM, you can configure any of the following attributes at initialization or in each subsequent call.

```python linenums="1"
gpt_4o_mini = dspy.LM('openai/gpt-4o-mini', temperature=0.9, max_tokens=3000, stop=None, cache=False)
```

By default LMs in DSPy are cached. If you repeat the same call, you will get the same outputs. But you can turn off caching by setting `cache=False`.


## Inspecting output and usage metadata.

Every LM object maintains the history of its interactions, including inputs, outputs, token usage (and $$$ cost), and metadata.

```python linenums="1"
len(lm.history)  # e.g., 3 calls to the LM

lm.history[-1].keys()  # access the last call to the LM, with all metadata
```

**Output:**
```text
dict_keys(['prompt', 'messages', 'kwargs', 'response', 'outputs', 'usage', 'cost'])
```

### Advanced: Building custom LMs and writing your own Adapters.

Though rarely needed, you can write custom LMs by inheriting from `dspy.BaseLM`. Another advanced layer in the DSPy ecosystem is that of _adapters_, which sit between DSPy signatures and LMs. A future version of this guide will discuss these advanced features, though you likely don't need them.

# Modules

A **DSPy module** is a building block for programs that use LMs.

- Each built-in module abstracts a **prompting technique** (like chain of thought or ReAct). Crucially, they are generalized to handle any signature.

- A DSPy module has **learnable parameters** (i.e., the little pieces comprising the prompt and the LM weights) and can be invoked (called) to process inputs and return outputs.

- Multiple modules can be composed into bigger modules (programs). DSPy modules are inspired directly by NN modules in PyTorch, but applied to LM programs.


## How do I use a built-in module, like `dspy.Predict` or `dspy.ChainOfThought`?

Let's start with the most fundamental module, `dspy.Predict`. Internally, all other DSPy modules are built using `dspy.Predict`. We'll assume you are already at least a little familiar with [DSPy signatures](/learn/programming/signatures), which are declarative specs for defining the behavior of any module we use in DSPy.

To use a module, we first **declare** it by giving it a signature. Then we **call** the module with the input arguments, and extract the output fields!

```python
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.

# 1) Declare with a signature.
classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment: bool')

# 2) Call with input argument(s).
response = classify(sentence=sentence)

# 3) Access the output.
print(response.sentiment)
```
**Output:**
```text
True
```

When we declare a module, we can pass configuration keys to it.

Below, we'll pass `n=5` to request five completions. We can also pass `temperature` or `max_len`, etc.

Let's use `dspy.ChainOfThought`. In many cases, simply swapping `dspy.ChainOfThought` in place of `dspy.Predict` improves quality.

```python
question = "What's something great about the ColBERT retrieval model?"

# 1) Declare with a signature, and pass some config.
classify = dspy.ChainOfThought('question -> answer', n=5)

# 2) Call with input argument.
response = classify(question=question)

# 3) Access the outputs.
response.completions.answer
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
['One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to other models.',
 'Its ability to efficiently retrieve relevant information from large document collections.',
 'One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior performance compared to other models and its efficient use of pre-trained language models.',
 'One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and accuracy compared to other models.',
 'One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its ability to incorporate user feedback and support complex queries.']
```

Let's discuss the output object here. The `dspy.ChainOfThought` module will generally inject a `reasoning` before the output field(s) of your signature.

Let's inspect the (first) reasoning and answer!

```python
print(f"Reasoning: {response.reasoning}")
print(f"Answer: {response.answer}")
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
Reasoning: We can consider the fact that ColBERT has shown to outperform other state-of-the-art retrieval models in terms of efficiency and effectiveness. It uses contextualized embeddings and performs document retrieval in a way that is both accurate and scalable.
Answer: One great thing about the ColBERT retrieval model is its superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to other models.
```

This is accessible whether we request one or many completions.

We can also access the different completions as a list of `Prediction`s or as several lists, one for each field.

```python
response.completions[3].reasoning == response.completions.reasoning[3]
```
**Output:**
```text
True
```


## What other DSPy modules are there? How can I use them?

The others are very similar. They mainly change the internal behavior with which your signature is implemented!

1. **`dspy.Predict`**: Basic predictor. Does not modify the signature. Handles the key forms of learning (i.e., storing the instructions and demonstrations and updates to the LM).

2. **`dspy.ChainOfThought`**: Teaches the LM to think step-by-step before committing to the signature's response.

3. **`dspy.ProgramOfThought`**: Teaches the LM to output code, whose execution results will dictate the response.

4. **`dspy.ReAct`**: An agent that can use tools to implement the given signature.

5. **`dspy.MultiChainComparison`**: Can compare multiple outputs from `ChainOfThought` to produce a final prediction.


We also have some function-style modules:

6. **`dspy.majority`**: Can do basic voting to return the most popular response from a set of predictions.


!!! info "A few examples of DSPy modules on simple tasks."
    Try the examples below after configuring your `lm`. Adjust the fields to explore what tasks your LM can do well out of the box.

    === "Math"

        ```python linenums="1"
        math = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer: float")
        math(question="Two dice are tossed. What is the probability that the sum equals two?")
        ```

        **Possible Output:**
        ```text
        Prediction(
            reasoning='When two dice are tossed, each die has 6 faces, resulting in a total of 6 x 6 = 36 possible outcomes. The sum of the numbers on the two dice equals two only when both dice show a 1. This is just one specific outcome: (1, 1). Therefore, there is only 1 favorable outcome. The probability of the sum being two is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes, which is 1/36.',
            answer=0.0277776
        )
        ```

    === "Retrieval-Augmented Generation"

        ```python linenums="1"
        def search(query: str) -> list[str]:
            """Retrieves abstracts from Wikipedia."""
            results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=3)
            return [x['text'] for x in results]

        rag = dspy.ChainOfThought('context, question -> response')

        question = "What's the name of the castle that David Gregory inherited?"
        rag(context=search(question), question=question)
        ```

        **Possible Output:**
        ```text
        Prediction(
            reasoning='The context provides information about David Gregory, a Scottish physician and inventor. It specifically mentions that he inherited Kinnairdy Castle in 1664. This detail directly answers the question about the name of the castle that David Gregory inherited.',
            response='Kinnairdy Castle'
        )
        ```

    === "Classification"

        ```python linenums="1"
        from typing import Literal

        class Classify(dspy.Signature):
            """Classify sentiment of a given sentence."""

            sentence: str = dspy.InputField()
            sentiment: Literal['positive', 'negative', 'neutral'] = dspy.OutputField()
            confidence: float = dspy.OutputField()

        classify = dspy.Predict(Classify)
        classify(sentence="This book was super fun to read, though not the last chapter.")
        ```

        **Possible Output:**

        ```text
        Prediction(
            sentiment='positive',
            confidence=0.75
        )
        ```

    === "Information Extraction"

        ```python linenums="1"
        text = "Apple Inc. announced its latest iPhone 14 today. The CEO, Tim Cook, highlighted its new features in a press release."

        module = dspy.Predict("text -> title, headings: list[str], entities_and_metadata: list[dict[str, str]]")
        response = module(text=text)

        print(response.title)
        print(response.headings)
        print(response.entities_and_metadata)
        ```

        **Possible Output:**
        ```text
        Apple Unveils iPhone 14
        ['Introduction', 'Key Features', "CEO's Statement"]
        [{'entity': 'Apple Inc.', 'type': 'Organization'}, {'entity': 'iPhone 14', 'type': 'Product'}, {'entity': 'Tim Cook', 'type': 'Person'}]
        ```

    === "Agents"

        ```python linenums="1"
        def evaluate_math(expression: str) -> float:
            return dspy.PythonInterpreter({}).execute(expression)

        def search_wikipedia(query: str) -> str:
            results = dspy.ColBERTv2(url='http://20.102.90.50:2017/wiki17_abstracts')(query, k=3)
            return [x['text'] for x in results]

        react = dspy.ReAct("question -> answer: float", tools=[evaluate_math, search_wikipedia])

        pred = react(question="What is 9362158 divided by the year of birth of David Gregory of Kinnairdy castle?")
        print(pred.answer)
        ```

        **Possible Output:**

        ```text
        5761.328
        ```


## How do I compose multiple modules into a bigger program?

DSPy is just Python code that uses modules in any control flow you like, with a little magic internally at `compile` time to trace your LM calls. What this means is that, you can just call the modules freely.

See tutorials like [multi-hop search](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/multihop_search/), whose module is reproduced below as an example.

```python linenums="1"
class Hop(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_docs=10, num_hops=4):
        self.num_docs, self.num_hops = num_docs, num_hops
        self.generate_query = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes -> query')
        self.append_notes = dspy.ChainOfThought('claim, notes, context -> new_notes: list[str], titles: list[str]')

    def forward(self, claim: str) -> list[str]:
        notes = []
        titles = []

        for _ in range(self.num_hops):
            query = self.generate_query(claim=claim, notes=notes).query
            context = search(query, k=self.num_docs)
            prediction = self.append_notes(claim=claim, notes=notes, context=context)
            notes.extend(prediction.new_notes)
            titles.extend(prediction.titles)

        return dspy.Prediction(notes=notes, titles=list(set(titles)))
```

## How do I track LM usage?

!!! note "Version Requirement"
    LM usage tracking is available in DSPy version 2.6.16 and later.

DSPy provides built-in tracking of language model usage across all module calls. To enable tracking:

```python
dspy.settings.configure(track_usage=True)
```

Once enabled, you can access usage statistics from any `dspy.Prediction` object:

```python
usage = prediction_instance.get_lm_usage()
```

The usage data is returned as a dictionary that maps each language model name to its usage statistics. Here's a complete example:

```python
import dspy

# Configure DSPy with tracking enabled
dspy.settings.configure(
    lm=dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini", cache=False),
    track_usage=True
)

# Define a simple program that makes multiple LM calls
class MyProgram(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        self.predict1 = dspy.ChainOfThought("question -> answer")
        self.predict2 = dspy.ChainOfThought("question, answer -> score")

    def __call__(self, question: str) -> str:
        answer = self.predict1(question=question)
        score = self.predict2(question=question, answer=answer)
        return score

# Run the program and check usage
program = MyProgram()
output = program(question="What is the capital of France?")
print(output.get_lm_usage())
```

This will output usage statistics like:

```python
{
    'openai/gpt-4o-mini': {
        'completion_tokens': 61,
        'prompt_tokens': 260,
        'total_tokens': 321,
        'completion_tokens_details': {
            'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0,
            'audio_tokens': 0,
            'reasoning_tokens': 0,
            'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0,
            'text_tokens': None
        },
        'prompt_tokens_details': {
            'audio_tokens': 0,
            'cached_tokens': 0,
            'text_tokens': None,
            'image_tokens': None
        }
    }
}
```

When using DSPy's caching features (either in-memory or on-disk via litellm), cached responses won't count toward usage statistics. For example:

```python
# Enable caching
dspy.settings.configure(
    lm=dspy.LM("openai/gpt-4o-mini", cache=True),
    track_usage=True
)

program = MyProgram()

# First call - will show usage statistics
output = program(question="What is the capital of Zambia?")
print(output.get_lm_usage())  # Shows token usage

# Second call - same question, will use cache
output = program(question="What is the capital of Zambia?")
print(output.get_lm_usage())  # Shows empty dict: {}
```

# Programming in DSPy

DSPy is a bet on _writing code instead of strings_. In other words, building the right control flow is crucial. Start by **defining your task**. What are the inputs to your system and what should your system produce as output? Is it a chatbot over your data or perhaps a code assistant? Or maybe a system for translation, for highlighting snippets from search results, or for generating reports with citations?

Next, **define your initial pipeline**. Can your DSPy program just be a single module or do you need to break it down into a few steps? Do you need retrieval or other tools, like a calculator or a calendar API? Is there a typical workflow for solving your problem in multiple well-scoped steps, or do you want more open-ended tool use with agents for your task? Think about these but start simple, perhaps with just a single `dspy.ChainOfThought` module, then add complexity incrementally based on observations.

As you do this, **craft and try a handful of examples** of the inputs to your program. Consider using a powerful LM at this point, or a couple of different LMs, just to understand what's possible. Record interesting (both easy and hard) examples you try. This will be useful when you are doing evaluation and optimization later.


??? "Beyond encouraging good design patterns, how does DSPy help here?"

    Conventional prompts couple your fundamental system architecture with incidental choices not portable to new LMs, objectives, or pipelines. A conventional prompt asks the LM to take some inputs and produce some outputs of certain types (a _signature_), formats the inputs in certain ways and requests outputs in a form it can parse accurately (an _adapter_), asks the LM to apply certain strategies like "thinking step by step" or using tools (a _module_'s logic), and relies on substantial trial-and-error to discover the right way to ask each LM to do this (a form of manual _optimization_).

    DSPy separates these concerns and automates the lower-level ones until you need to consider them. This allow you to write much shorter code, with much higher portability. For example, if you write a program using DSPy modules, you can swap the LM or its adapter without changing the rest of your logic. Or you can exchange one _module_, like `dspy.ChainOfThought`, with another, like `dspy.ProgramOfThought`, without modifying your signatures. When you're ready to use optimizers, the same program can have its prompts optimized or its LM weights fine-tuned.

# Signatures

When we assign tasks to LMs in DSPy, we specify the behavior we need as a Signature.

**A signature is a declarative specification of input/output behavior of a DSPy module.** Signatures allow you to tell the LM _what_ it needs to do, rather than specify _how_ we should ask the LM to do it.

You're probably familiar with function signatures, which specify the input and output arguments and their types. DSPy signatures are similar, but with a couple of differences. While typical function signatures just _describe_ things, DSPy Signatures _declare and initialize the behavior_ of modules. Moreover, the field names matter in DSPy Signatures. You express semantic roles in plain English: a `question` is different from an `answer`, a `sql_query` is different from `python_code`.

## Why should I use a DSPy Signature?

For modular and clean code, in which LM calls can be optimized into high-quality prompts (or automatic finetunes). Most people coerce LMs to do tasks by hacking long, brittle prompts. Or by collecting/generating data for fine-tuning. Writing signatures is far more modular, adaptive, and reproducible than hacking at prompts or finetunes. The DSPy compiler will figure out how to build a highly-optimized prompt for your LM (or finetune your small LM) for your signature, on your data, and within your pipeline. In many cases, we found that compiling leads to better prompts than humans write. Not because DSPy optimizers are more creative than humans, but simply because they can try more things and tune the metrics directly.

## **Inline** DSPy Signatures

Signatures can be defined as a short string, with argument names and optional types that define semantic roles for inputs/outputs.

1. Question Answering: `"question -> answer"`, which is equivalent to `"question: str -> answer: str"` as the default type is always `str`

2. Sentiment Classification: `"sentence -> sentiment: bool"`, e.g. `True` if positive

3. Summarization: `"document -> summary"`

Your signatures can also have multiple input/output fields with types:

4. Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering: `"context: list[str], question: str -> answer: str"`

5. Multiple-Choice Question Answering with Reasoning: `"question, choices: list[str] -> reasoning: str, selection: int"`

**Tip:** For fields, any valid variable names work! Field names should be semantically meaningful, but start simple and don't prematurely optimize keywords! Leave that kind of hacking to the DSPy compiler. For example, for summarization, it's probably fine to say `"document -> summary"`, `"text -> gist"`, or `"long_context -> tldr"`.

You can also add instructions to your inline signature, which can use variables at runtime. Use the `instructions` keyword argument to add instructions to your signature.

```python
toxicity = dspy.Predict(
    dspy.Signature(
        "comment -> toxic: bool",
        instructions="Mark as 'toxic' if the comment includes insults, harassment, or sarcastic derogatory remarks.",
    )
)
```

### Example A: Sentiment Classification

```python
sentence = "it's a charming and often affecting journey."  # example from the SST-2 dataset.

classify = dspy.Predict('sentence -> sentiment: bool')  # we'll see an example with Literal[] later
classify(sentence=sentence).sentiment
```
**Output:**
```text
True
```

### Example B: Summarization

```python
# Example from the XSum dataset.
document = """The 21-year-old made seven appearances for the Hammers and netted his only goal for them in a Europa League qualification round match against Andorran side FC Lustrains last season. Lee had two loan spells in League One last term, with Blackpool and then Colchester United. He scored twice for the U's but was unable to save them from relegation. The length of Lee's contract with the promoted Tykes has not been revealed. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page."""

summarize = dspy.ChainOfThought('document -> summary')
response = summarize(document=document)

print(response.summary)
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
The 21-year-old Lee made seven appearances and scored one goal for West Ham last season. He had loan spells in League One with Blackpool and Colchester United, scoring twice for the latter. He has now signed a contract with Barnsley, but the length of the contract has not been revealed.
```

Many DSPy modules (except `dspy.Predict`) return auxiliary information by expanding your signature under the hood.

For example, `dspy.ChainOfThought` also adds a `reasoning` field that includes the LM's reasoning before it generates the output `summary`.

```python
print("Reasoning:", response.reasoning)
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
Reasoning: We need to highlight Lee's performance for West Ham, his loan spells in League One, and his new contract with Barnsley. We also need to mention that his contract length has not been disclosed.
```

## **Class-based** DSPy Signatures

For some advanced tasks, you need more verbose signatures. This is typically to:

1. Clarify something about the nature of the task (expressed below as a `docstring`).

2. Supply hints on the nature of an input field, expressed as a `desc` keyword argument for `dspy.InputField`.

3. Supply constraints on an output field, expressed as a `desc` keyword argument for `dspy.OutputField`.

### Example C: Classification

```python
from typing import Literal

class Emotion(dspy.Signature):
    """Classify emotion."""

    sentence: str = dspy.InputField()
    sentiment: Literal['sadness', 'joy', 'love', 'anger', 'fear', 'surprise'] = dspy.OutputField()

sentence = "i started feeling a little vulnerable when the giant spotlight started blinding me"  # from dair-ai/emotion

classify = dspy.Predict(Emotion)
classify(sentence=sentence)
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
Prediction(
    sentiment='fear'
)
```

**Tip:** There's nothing wrong with specifying your requests to the LM more clearly. Class-based Signatures help you with that. However, don't prematurely tune the keywords of your signature by hand. The DSPy optimizers will likely do a better job (and will transfer better across LMs).

### Example D: A metric that evaluates faithfulness to citations

```python
class CheckCitationFaithfulness(dspy.Signature):
    """Verify that the text is based on the provided context."""

    context: str = dspy.InputField(desc="facts here are assumed to be true")
    text: str = dspy.InputField()
    faithfulness: bool = dspy.OutputField()
    evidence: dict[str, list[str]] = dspy.OutputField(desc="Supporting evidence for claims")

context = "The 21-year-old made seven appearances for the Hammers and netted his only goal for them in a Europa League qualification round match against Andorran side FC Lustrains last season. Lee had two loan spells in League One last term, with Blackpool and then Colchester United. He scored twice for the U's but was unable to save them from relegation. The length of Lee's contract with the promoted Tykes has not been revealed. Find all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page."

text = "Lee scored 3 goals for Colchester United."

faithfulness = dspy.ChainOfThought(CheckCitationFaithfulness)
faithfulness(context=context, text=text)
```
**Possible Output:**
```text
Prediction(
    reasoning="Let's check the claims against the context. The text states Lee scored 3 goals for Colchester United, but the context clearly states 'He scored twice for the U's'. This is a direct contradiction.",
    faithfulness=False,
    evidence={'goal_count': ["scored twice for the U's"]}
)
```

### Example E: Multi-modal image classification

```python
class DogPictureSignature(dspy.Signature):
    """Output the dog breed of the dog in the image."""
    image_1: dspy.Image = dspy.InputField(desc="An image of a dog")
    answer: str = dspy.OutputField(desc="The dog breed of the dog in the image")

image_url = "https://picsum.photos/id/237/200/300"
classify = dspy.Predict(DogPictureSignature)
classify(image_1=dspy.Image.from_url(image_url))
```

**Possible Output:**

```text
Prediction(
    answer='Labrador Retriever'
)
```

## Type Resolution in Signatures

DSPy signatures support various annotation types:

1. **Basic types** like `str`, `int`, `bool`
2. **Typing module types** like `List[str]`, `Dict[str, int]`, `Optional[float]`. `Union[str, int]`
3. **Custom types** defined in your code
4. **Dot notation** for nested types with proper configuration
5. **Special data types** like `dspy.Image, dspy.History`

### Working with Custom Types

```python
# Simple custom type
class QueryResult(pydantic.BaseModel):
    text: str
    score: float

signature = dspy.Signature("query: str -> result: QueryResult")

class Container:
    class Query(pydantic.BaseModel):
        text: str
    class Score(pydantic.BaseModel):
        score: float

signature = dspy.Signature("query: Container.Query -> score: Container.Score")
```

## Using signatures to build modules & compiling them

While signatures are convenient for prototyping with structured inputs/outputs, that's not the only reason to use them!

You should compose multiple signatures into bigger [DSPy modules](modules.md) and [compile these modules into optimized prompts](../optimization/optimizers.md) and finetunes.

# Learning DSPy: An Overview

DSPy exposes a very small API that you can learn quickly. However, building a new AI system is a more open-ended journey of iterative development, in which you compose the tools and design patterns of DSPy to optimize for _your_ objectives. The three stages of building AI systems in DSPy are:

1) **DSPy Programming.** This is about defining your task, its constraints, exploring a few examples, and using that to inform your initial pipeline design.

2) **DSPy Evaluation.** Once your system starts working, this is the stage where you collect an initial development set, define your DSPy metric, and use these to iterate on your system more systematically.

3) **DSPy Optimization.** Once you have a way to evaluate your system, you use DSPy optimizers to tune the prompts or weights in your program.

We suggest learning and applying DSPy in this order. For example, it's unproductive to launch optimization runs using a poorly-design program or a bad metric.

# Utilizing Built-in Datasets

It's easy to use your own data in DSPy: a dataset is just a list of `Example` objects. Using DSPy well involves being able to find and re-purpose existing datasets for your own pipelines in new ways; DSPy makes this a particularly powerful strategy.

For convenience, DSPy currently also provides support for the following dataset out of the box:

* **HotPotQA** (multi-hop question answering)
* **GSM8k** (math questions)
* **Color** (basic dataset of colors)


## Loading HotPotQA

HotPotQA is which is a collection of question-answer pairs.

```python
from dspy.datasets import HotPotQA

dataset = HotPotQA(train_seed=1, train_size=5, eval_seed=2023, dev_size=50, test_size=0)

print(dataset.train)
```
**Output:**
```text
[Example({'question': 'At My Window was released by which American singer-songwriter?', 'answer': 'John Townes Van Zandt'}) (input_keys=None),
 Example({'question': 'which  American actor was Candace Kita  guest starred with ', 'answer': 'Bill Murray'}) (input_keys=None),
 Example({'question': 'Which of these publications was most recently published, Who Put the Bomp or Self?', 'answer': 'Self'}) (input_keys=None),
 Example({'question': 'The Victorians - Their Story In Pictures is a documentary series written by an author born in what year?', 'answer': '1950'}) (input_keys=None),
 Example({'question': 'Which magazine has published articles by Scott Shaw, Tae Kwon Do Times or Southwest Art?', 'answer': 'Tae Kwon Do Times'}) (input_keys=None)]
```

We just loaded trainset (5 examples) and devset (50 examples). Each example in our training set contains just a question and its (human-annotated) answer. As you can see, it is loaded as a list of `Example` objects. However, one thing to note is that it doesn't set the input keys implicitly, so that is something that we'll need to do!!

```python
trainset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in dataset.train]
devset = [x.with_inputs('question') for x in dataset.dev]

print(trainset)
```
**Output:**
```text
[Example({'question': 'At My Window was released by which American singer-songwriter?', 'answer': 'John Townes Van Zandt'}) (input_keys={'question'}),
 Example({'question': 'which  American actor was Candace Kita  guest starred with ', 'answer': 'Bill Murray'}) (input_keys={'question'}),
 Example({'question': 'Which of these publications was most recently published, Who Put the Bomp or Self?', 'answer': 'Self'}) (input_keys={'question'}),
 Example({'question': 'The Victorians - Their Story In Pictures is a documentary series written by an author born in what year?', 'answer': '1950'}) (input_keys={'question'}),
 Example({'question': 'Which magazine has published articles by Scott Shaw, Tae Kwon Do Times or Southwest Art?', 'answer': 'Tae Kwon Do Times'}) (input_keys={'question'})]
```

DSPy typically requires very minimal labeling. Whereas your pipeline may involve six or seven complex steps, you only need labels for the initial question and the final answer. DSPy will bootstrap any intermediate labels needed to support your pipeline. If you change your pipeline in any way, the data bootstrapped will change accordingly!


## Advanced: Inside DSPy's `Dataset` class (Optional)

We've seen how you can use `HotPotQA` dataset class and load the HotPotQA dataset, but how does it actually work? The `HotPotQA` class inherits from the `Dataset` class, which takes care of the conversion of the data loaded from a source into train-test-dev split, all of which are *list of examples*. In the `HotPotQA` class, you only implement the `__init__` method, where you populate the splits from HuggingFace into the variables `_train`, `_test` and `_dev`. The rest of the process is handled by methods in the `Dataset` class.

![Dataset Loading Process in HotPotQA Class](./img/data-loading.png)

But how do the methods of the `Dataset` class convert the data from HuggingFace? Let's take a deep breath and think step by step...pun intended. In example above, we can see the splits accessed by `.train`, `.dev` and `.test` methods, so let's take a look at the implementation of the `train()` method:

```python
@property
def train(self):
    if not hasattr(self, '_train_'):
        self._train_ = self._shuffle_and_sample('train', self._train, self.train_size, self.train_seed)

    return self._train_
```

As you can see, the `train()` method serves as a property, not a regular method. Within this property, it first checks if the `_train_` attribute exists. If not, it calls the `_shuffle_and_sample()` method to process the `self._train` where the HuggingFace dataset is loaded. Let's see the  `_shuffle_and_sample()` method:

```python
def _shuffle_and_sample(self, split, data, size, seed=0):
    data = list(data)
    base_rng = random.Random(seed)

    if self.do_shuffle:
        base_rng.shuffle(data)

    data = data[:size]
    output = []

    for example in data:
        output.append(Example(**example, dspy_uuid=str(uuid.uuid4()), dspy_split=split))

        return output
```

The `_shuffle_and_sample()` method does two things:

* It shuffles the data if `self.do_shuffle` is True.
* It then takes a sample of size `size` from the shuffled data.
* It then loops through the sampled data and converts each element in `data` into an `Example` object. The `Example` along with example data also contains a unique ID, and the split name.

Converting the raw examples into `Example` objects allows the Dataset class to process them in a standardized way later. For example, the collate method, which is used by the PyTorch DataLoader, expects each item to be an `Example`.

To summarize, the `Dataset` class handles all the necessary data processing and provides a simple API to access the different splits. This differentiates from the dataset classes like HotpotQA which require only definitions on how to load the raw data.

# Examples in DSPy

Working in DSPy involves training sets, development sets, and test sets. This is like traditional ML, but you usually need far fewer labels (or zero labels) to use DSPy effectively.

The core data type for data in DSPy is `Example`. You will use **Examples** to represent items in your training set and test set.

DSPy **Examples** are similar to Python `dict`s but have a few useful utilities. Your DSPy modules will return values of the type `Prediction`, which is a special sub-class of `Example`.

## Creating an `Example`

When you use DSPy, you will do a lot of evaluation and optimization runs. Your individual datapoints will be of type `Example`:

```python
qa_pair = dspy.Example(question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.")

print(qa_pair)
print(qa_pair.question)
print(qa_pair.answer)
```
**Output:**
```text
Example({'question': 'This is a question?', 'answer': 'This is an answer.'}) (input_keys=None)
This is a question?
This is an answer.
```

Examples can have any field keys and any value types, though usually values are strings.

```text
object = Example(field1=value1, field2=value2, field3=value3, ...)
```

## Specifying Input Keys

In traditional ML, there are separated "inputs" and "labels".

In DSPy, the `Example` objects have a `with_inputs()` method, which can mark specific fields as inputs. (The rest are just metadata or labels.)

```python
# Single Input.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question"))

# Multiple Inputs; be careful about marking your labels as inputs unless you mean it.
print(qa_pair.with_inputs("question", "answer"))
```

This flexibility allows for customized tailoring of the `Example` object for different DSPy scenarios.

When you call `with_inputs()`, you get a new copy of the example. The original object is kept unchanged.


## Element Access and Updation

Values can be accessed using the `.`(dot) operator. You can access the value of key `name` in defined object `Example(name="John Doe", job="sleep")` through `object.name`.

To access or exclude certain keys, use `inputs()` and `labels()` methods to return new Example objects containing only input or non-input keys, respectively.

```python
article_summary = dspy.Example(article= "This is an article.", summary= "This is a summary.").with_inputs("article")

input_key_only = article_summary.inputs()
non_input_key_only = article_summary.labels()

print("Example object with Input fields only:", input_key_only)
print("Example object with Non-Input fields only:", non_input_key_only)
```

**Output**
```
Example object with Input fields only: Example({'article': 'This is an article.'}) (input_keys=None)
Example object with Non-Input fields only: Example({'summary': 'This is a summary.'}) (input_keys=None)
```

To exclude keys, use `without()`:

```python
article_summary = dspy.Example(context="This is an article.", question="This is a question?", answer="This is an answer.", rationale= "This is a rationale.").with_inputs("context", "question")

print("Example object without answer & rationale keys:", article_summary.without("answer", "rationale"))
```

**Output**
```
Example object without answer & rationale keys: Example({'context': 'This is an article.', 'question': 'This is a question?'}) (input_keys=None)
```

Updating values is simply assigning a new value using the `.` operator.

```python
article_summary.context = "new context"
```

## Iterating over Example

Iteration in the `Example` class also functions like a dictionary, supporting methods like `keys()`, `values()`, etc:

```python
for k, v in article_summary.items():
    print(f"{k} = {v}")
```

**Output**

```text
context = This is an article.
question = This is a question?
answer = This is an answer.
rationale = This is a rationale.
```

# Creating a Custom Dataset

We've seen how to work with with `Example` objects and use the `HotPotQA` class to load the HuggingFace HotPotQA dataset as a list of `Example` objects. But in production, such structured datasets are rare. Instead, you'll find yourself working on a custom dataset and might question: how do I create my own dataset or what format should it be?

In DSPy, your dataset is a list of `Examples`, which we can accomplish in two ways:

* **Recommended: The Pythonic Way:** Using native python utility and logic.
* **Advanced: Using DSPy's `Dataset` class**

## Recommended: The Pythonic Way

To create a list of `Example` objects, we can simply load data from the source and formulate it into a Python list. Let's load an example CSV `sample.csv` that contains 3 fields: (**context**, **question** and **summary**) via Pandas. From there, we can construct our data list.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("sample.csv")
print(df.shape)
```
**Output:**
```text
(1000, 3)
```
```python
dataset = []

for context, question, answer in df.values:
    dataset.append(dspy.Example(context=context, question=question, answer=answer).with_inputs("context", "question"))

print(dataset[:3])
```
**Output:**
```python
[Example({'context': nan, 'question': 'Which is a species of fish? Tope or Rope', 'answer': 'Tope'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context'}),
 Example({'context': nan, 'question': 'Why can camels survive for long without water?', 'answer': 'Camels use the fat in their humps to keep them filled with energy and hydration for long periods of time.'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context'}),
 Example({'context': nan, 'question': "Alice's parents have three daughters: Amy, Jessy, and what’s the name of the third daughter?", 'answer': 'The name of the third daughter is Alice'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context'})]
```

While this is fairly simple, let's take a look at how loading datasets would look in DSPy - via the DSPythonic way!

## Advanced: Using DSPy's `Dataset` class (Optional)

Let's take advantage of the `Dataset` class we defined in the previous article to accomplish the preprocessing:

* Load data from CSV to a dataframe.
* Split the data to train, dev and test splits.
* Populate `_train`, `_dev` and `_test` class attributes. Note that these attributes should be a list of dictionary, or an iterator over mapping like HuggingFace Dataset, to make it work.

This is all done through the `__init__` method, which is the only method we have to implement.

```python
import pandas as pd
from dspy.datasets.dataset import Dataset

class CSVDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, file_path, *args, **kwargs) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

        df = pd.read_csv(file_path)
        self._train = df.iloc[0:700].to_dict(orient='records')

        self._dev = df.iloc[700:].to_dict(orient='records')

dataset = CSVDataset("sample.csv")
print(dataset.train[:3])
```
**Output:**
```text
[Example({'context': nan, 'question': 'Which is a species of fish? Tope or Rope', 'answer': 'Tope'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context'}),
 Example({'context': nan, 'question': 'Why can camels survive for long without water?', 'answer': 'Camels use the fat in their humps to keep them filled with energy and hydration for long periods of time.'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context'}),
 Example({'context': nan, 'question': "Alice's parents have three daughters: Amy, Jessy, and what’s the name of the third daughter?", 'answer': 'The name of the third daughter is Alice'}) (input_keys={'question', 'context'})]
```

Let's understand the code step by step:

* It inherits the base `Dataset` class from DSPy. This inherits all the useful data loading/processing functionality.
* We load the data in CSV into a DataFrame.
* We get the **train** split i.e first 700 rows in the DataFrame and convert it to lists of dicts using `to_dict(orient='records')` method and is then assigned to `self._train`.
* We get the **dev** split i.e first 300 rows in the DataFrame and convert it to lists of dicts using `to_dict(orient='records')` method and is then assigned to `self._dev`.

Using the Dataset base class now makes loading custom datasets incredibly easy and avoids having to write all that boilerplate code ourselves for every new dataset.

!!! caution

    We did not populate `_test` attribute in the above code, which is fine and won't cause any unnecessary error as such. However it'll give you an error if you try to access the test split.

    ```python
    dataset.test[:5]
    ```
    ****
    ```text
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-59-5202f6de3c7b> in <cell line: 1>()
    ----> 1 dataset.test[:5]

    /usr/local/lib/python3.10/dist-packages/dspy/datasets/dataset.py in test(self)
        51     def test(self):
        52         if not hasattr(self, '_test_'):
    ---> 53             self._test_ = self._shuffle_and_sample('test', self._test, self.test_size, self.test_seed)
        54
        55         return self._test_

    AttributeError: 'CSVDataset' object has no attribute '_test'
    ```

    To prevent that you'll just need to make sure `_test` is not `None` and populated with the appropriate data.

You can override the methods in `Dataset` class to customize your class even more.

In summary, the Dataset base class provides a simplistic way to load and preprocess custom datasets with minimal code!
