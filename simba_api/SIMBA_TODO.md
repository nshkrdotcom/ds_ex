Now let me create a summary document that ties everything together:## Summary

I've provided a comprehensive solution to address the fundamental issue you identified: **the tests expect API contracts that don't exist in the DSPEx implementation.**

### What I've Delivered:

1. **üîç Problem Analysis**: Confirmed that tests were modified to expect APIs like `Program.safe_program_info/1`, `has_demos?/1`, enhanced `forward/3`, etc., but these were never implemented in the library code.

2. **üìã Formal API Contract Specification**: Complete specification of what SIMBA needs from DSPEx, with clear requirements for each API.

3. **üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap**: 3-day phased implementation plan with specific tasks, timelines, and success criteria.

4. **üíª Ready-to-Apply Code Patches**: Exact code modifications needed for:
   - `lib/dspex/program.ex` - Missing introspection functions
   - `lib/dspex/optimized_program.ex` - SIMBA metadata support
   - `lib/dspex/services/config_manager.ex` - SIMBA configuration paths
   - `lib/dspex/client.ex` - Response format stabilization
   - `lib/dspex/teleprompter/bootstrap_fewshot.ex` - Empty demo handling
   - `lib/dspex/services/telemetry_setup.ex` - SIMBA telemetry events

5. **üß™ Comprehensive Test Suite**: Contract validation tests that ensure all SIMBA requirements are met, including integration smoke tests.

### Critical Implementation Priority:

**üî¥ CRITICAL BLOCKERS** that must be implemented before SIMBA:
- Program.forward/3 with options support
- Program introspection functions (program_type, safe_program_info, has_demos)
- Client response format stability  
- OptimizedProgram metadata support
- ConfigManager SIMBA configuration paths

This provides the formal API contract definition and implementation guide needed to bridge DSPEx and SIMBA successfully. The implementation should take 2-3 focused days and will resolve the fundamental contract mismatch issue.
